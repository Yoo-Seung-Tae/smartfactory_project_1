2024-12-23,AI will eavesdrop on world's wildest places to track and help protect endangered wildlife,A biologist hid 350 audio monitors across Costa Rica’s tropical rainforests to spy on endangered spider monkeys in order to help protect them,"PUERTO JIMÉNEZ, Costa Rica -- The endangered Geoffrey’s spider monkeys that dangle high in the rainforest canopy are elusive and hard for scientists to track.
So biologist Jenna Lawson hid 350 audio monitors in trees across Costa Rica's lush Osa Peninsula to spy on them.
The devices recorded the sounds of the forest and surrounding countryside for a week, collecting so much data that Lawson could have spent years listening to it all.
Instead, she fed it into artificial intelligence systems trained to instantly recognize spider monkey calls and detect where the animals traveled. One of the world’s largest acoustic wildlife studies when Lawson began the project in 2021, it revealed troubling findings about the health of a treasured wildlife refuge.
More of this AI-assisted wildlife surveillance is “urgently needed” as some 28% of all plant and animal species are now at risk of extinction, according to a paper published in the academic journal Science this summer. Researchers from Dutch and Danish universities showed that machine-learning techniques can “handle huge amounts of data and uncover sound patterns, allowing for faster, cheaper, and better ecological studies” that can aid in biodiversity conservation. But many technical challenges remain.
Tech giant Microsoft's philanthropic AI for Good Lab announced this month it is hoping to answer some of those technical challenges with a new kind of hardware and computing system for eavesdropping on the planet's wildest places.
“Those remote places are also the most important places on the Earth from a biodiversity perspective,” said Microsoft's chief data scientist, Juan Lavista Ferres, in an interview last week by video call from Colombia, where a research team was preparing to test the new approach.
Powered by the sun and energy-efficient AI computer chips, the devices can run for years rather than weeks without human intervention. And they can regularly transmit their data online via low-Earth orbit satellites. It's called Sparrow, short for Solar-Powered Acoustic and Remote Recording Observation Watch.
Pablo Arbelaez, director of an AI-focused research center at the University of the Andes, said a first Sparrow test will happen in a jungle preserve along Colombia's largest river, the Magdalena. Eventually, the researchers hope to get a better idea of how deforestation — and efforts to reverse it — is affecting the population behavior of jaguars, blue-beaked paujil birds, spider monkeys and other endangered species.
Another project closer to Microsoft headquarters will monitor forests in Washington state's Cascade Mountains. By late 2025, Lavista Ferres plans to have devices on all continents, from remote corners of the Amazon rainforest to gorilla habitats of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That will then be “open-sourced” to make it accessible to a wide body of researchers in real time, but with measures to obscure sensitive location data.
“What we don’t want is these devices to ever be used for poachers to understand where the animals are,” Lavista Ferres said.
It was a concern about encroachments on Costa Rican spider monkey habitat that led Lawson, then at Imperial College London, to undertake her ambitious bio-acoustic study three years ago. She persuaded landowners to let her place recording devices on their properties outside Corcovado National Park, a jewel of Costa Rica's decades-long efforts to preserve biodiversity by encouraging wildlife tourism.
“She basically realized the spider monkey is in a really critical situation,” said local environmentalist and bug scientist Jim Córdoba-Alfaro. On a follow-up visit last year, he and Lawson trekked across a private reserve with an Associated Press reporter to observe the monkeys and check on the audio monitors.
Compared to the charismatic capuchin monkey and the notoriously loud howler monkey -- both commonly seen or heard throughout Costa Rica — spider monkeys are far more wary of humans and the changes they bring.
“They’re the most sensitive of the primates that we have here,” said Lawson. “The spider monkey would be the first animal to leave when there’s signs of trouble. They would be the last animal to come back once forests are restored because they need mature secondary and primary forest to be able to survive.”
The Royal Society of London in March 2023 published Lawson's findings of what the audio monitors revealed: the spider monkeys weren't going anywhere near paved roads or the plantations harvesting palm oil and teak wood that bisect the region's protected national parks. That meant government-designated wildlife corridors meant to extend their range through and beyond the Osa Peninsula were not working as well as designed. She came back to present those conclusions to local officials.
After hours of searching, a troop of spider monkeys appeared — peering down at the humans who found them. Within moments, they were on their way again — extending their lanky arms and prehensile tails to grasp at trees and propel themselves across the canopy with spidery acrobatics.
Unattended acoustic detection of animal sounds is valuable not just in rainforests but in a wide variety of ecosystems, according to the Science paper published earlier this year. For example, it could help sailors avoid colliding their ships with large baleen whales heard to be passing through a shipping channel.
Lavista Ferres said there are still numerous challenges to overcome, from humidity that can fray jungle monitors to elephants in African savannas unintentionally knocking them off a tree.
Lawson said using the audio monitors to capture the spider monkey's distinctive whinny enables biologists to study a larger area at lower cost, but also provides a truer account of how the monkeys behave without scientists following them around.
“We’re reducing our influence on their behavior,” she said. ”And also — they don’t want us here.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-23,"High schooler didn't see enough girls studying AI, so she built her own company",Ishani Singh created Girls Rule AI after attending a computer science competition where she was the only girl.,"For one high school student in New Jersey, a single computer science competition fueled a mission to get more teenage girls interested in artificial intelligence, or AI.
Ishani Singh, now 17, was a freshman at High Technology High School in 2021 when she attended a state computer science competition, where she noticed she was only one of a few female students competing.
When Singh went onto compete in the regional competition, she said she was ""shocked"" to see that she was the only female student competing.
""I looked around and there were, like, zero girls, and I was like, 'OK,'"" Singh told ABC News in an interview airing on ""The Year: 2024,"" an annual special airing Dec. 26 on ABC. ""That felt a little weird.""
The experience inspired Singh, now a high school senior, to launch Girls Rule AI, which aims to empower young women to learn about AI, a term that, according to NASA, ""refers to computer systems that can perform complex tasks normally done by human-reasoning, decision making, creating, etc.""
Ishani Singh founded Girls Rule AI after attending a computer science competition where she was the only girl.
ABC News
Since the start of the organization nearly three years ago, Girls Rule AI has taught free courses on AI to over 200 girls in 25 states and six countries around the world, including Kenya and Afghanistan, according to Singh.
Gloria Mwangi, a Girls Rule AI instructor in Kenya, said she believes women working in AI-related fields could be transformative.
""In Kenya, the interest in tech and AI is definitely growing,"" Mwangi told ABC News. ""I think AI has a lot of potential to make a difference for young women here.""
Singh added that the success of her company, she believes, has been in making AI more accessible to more girls.

""I think it's just because girls are a little afraid to just start on this journey in the first place,"" Singh said of the gender difference in AI. ""So, I think by creating this community, I was able to make girls feel a little more more comfortable and just get them more confident in this field.""
Even with the progress, Singh said she feels there is a lot of work to do when it comes to getting girls interested in AI so they can go onto careers in the science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, industries.
According to the American Association of University Women, women currently make up 34% of the STEM workforce and are particularly outnumbered by men in fast-growing and high-paying fields like engineering and computer science.
""We're not at the level that we should be,"" Singh said. ""I think there should be more women in the tech field.""

Singh added that she believes the more young girls who become interested in AI, the greater the experience will be for all people who use the technology.
""If we have this growing surge of interest among girls and women in the field ... they'll be able to provide valuable input into the AI models that we're putting out into the world these days,"" she said. ""So, it's great to see that people have the same passion that I do.""

2024-12-23,What is Red 40? Other food coloring up for possible ban in US,What to know about Red Dye No. 40 and artificial food coloring used in thousands of food and drink products sold in the U.S.,"Red Dye No. 40, a synthetic food dye that's used to achieve a bright crimson color in condiments and candy alike, has been a hot topic among policy makers and food safety advocates in the U.S.
While there are thousands of chemicals allowed for use in our country's commercial food system, many of those that have been reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have not been reevaluated for decades. Red 40, for example, was first registered with the FDA in 1971 and last evaluated for health risks by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2014.
What is Red 40?
A candy ingredients label featuring artificial food dyes including colors Red 40, Blue 2, and Yellow 5 is shown on Dec. 16, 2024, in Atlanta.

The artificial coloring that's synthesized from petroleum, also known as Allura Red AC, is one of the nine ""Trusted Source"" certified color additives the FDA approves for use in foods and beverages.
In processing the color, according to the FDA, the dye is combined with aluminum to create Red 40 Lake, which is not water soluble in order to prevent colors from bleeding in products like chewing gum.
During the Red 40 production process, per the FDA, each batch gets screened for purity certification and possible contaminants.
According to the Department of Agriculture's branded foods database, Red 40 is the most used per pound consumed among three food dyes found in over 36,000 food products sold in the U.S.
Some studies have shown Red 40 is a carcinogen in animals.
""Scientific studies have suggested a potential link between Red Dye 40 and hyperactivity, including ADHD and report noted improvements in behavior and attention when such dyes are eliminated from diets,"" Kantha Shelke, PhD, founder of food science research firm Corvus Blue and member of the Institute of Food Technologists, told ABC News.
Food policy discussions about red food dyes
The debate over processed foods and synthetic food dyes has had a resurgence in America, in large part as a result of heated criticism from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who President-elect Donald Trump has said would lead the Department of Health and Human Services in his new administration. Kennedy has voiced his intent to ""Make America Healthy Again"" if confirmed as HHS secretary, including cracking down on ultra-processed foods, many of which contain additives.

Like most issues related to commercially processed food and the potential health impacts, there is more research that needs be done to hone in on what and how much of something could be considered unsafe to eat.
At the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee meeting earlier this month, agency heads delivered blunt assessments of America's obesity problem and consumption of ultra-processed foods and chemicals in our food supply.
The outgoing FDA chief, Dr. Robert Califf, and his deputy commissioner for human foods, Jim Jones, said there's no legal path forward in banning these substances, such as Red 40 that hasn't been reevaluated in decades, without proper funding for scientific evidence.
What is Red 3?
Califf and Jones offered Red No. 3, another color additive made from petroleum that gives drinks and foods a cherry-red color, as an example of forward progress.
""With Red 3, we have a petition in front of us to revoke the authorization board, and we're hopeful that in the next few weeks, we'll be acting on that petition,"" Jones told lawmakers of the juxtaposition for the similar substance used in foods.
Red No. 3 has been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals, but many scientists do not believe the substance triggers the same ""mechanism of carcinogenicity"" when ingested by humans, Jones told the Senate panel.
In this My 19, 2020, file photo, a package of Skittles, a fruit-flavored candy, produced by Wrigley Company, a division of Mars, Inc., is shown.

Shelke said that ""evidence of the carcinogenicity of large doses of Red 3 in laboratory animals has been available since the 1980s,"" and noted that the ""FDA banned Red 3 in cosmetics"" in 1990,"" but 34 years later is still in the process of developing a new framework for post-market assessments of chemicals in food.""
Under current U.S. law, the FDA cannot ban Red No. 3 while scientists try to determine with certainty that it is safe for humans, it would take Congress to change that.
What's next for food dye regulations
But the task to correct course in food regulation is not impossible as increased public concern has driven recent legislation.
By the end of 2027, food served in California public schools must no longer include any product that contains artificial food colors -- including Red 40 -- thanks to a landmark bill that Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law earlier this year.
""Historically, the FDA has been reactive, addressing public health concerns only after external pressure in the form of petitions, lawsuits, or state-level bans,"" Shelke told ABC News. ""The FDA’s potential move to ban artificial food dyes may gain momentum as lawmakers in 10 states follow California’s lead by introducing similar legislation.""
The EPA and WHO list Red 40 as ""low concern"" and note that most people don’t typically take in enough of it to cause a problem.
However, the European Union requires a warning label on products that contain Red Dye 40 that reads, ""may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-23,The internet is rife with fake reviews. Will AI make it worse?,"Researchers and watchdog groups say the emergence of generative artificial intelligence tools that allow people to efficiently produce detailed and novel online reviews has put merchants, service providers and consumers in uncharted territory","The emergence of generative artificial intelligence tools that allow people to efficiently produce novel and detailed online reviews with almost no work has put merchants, service providers and consumers in uncharted territory, watchdog groups and researchers say.
Phony reviews have long plagued many popular consumer websites, such as Amazon and Yelp. They are typically traded on private social media groups between fake review brokers and businesses willing to pay. Sometimes, such reviews are initiated by businesses that offer customers incentives such as gift cards for positive feedback.
But AI-infused text generation tools, popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, enable fraudsters to produce reviews faster and in greater volume, according to tech industry experts.
The deceptive practice, which is illegal in the U.S., is carried out year-round but becomes a bigger problem for consumers during the holiday shopping season, when many people rely on reviews to help them purchase gifts.
Fake reviews are found across a wide range of industries, from e-commerce, lodging and restaurants, to services such as home repairs, medical care and piano lessons.
The Transparency Company, a tech company and watchdog group that uses software to detect fake reviews, said it started to see AI-generated reviews show up in large numbers in mid-2023 and they have multiplied ever since.
For a report released this month, The Transparency Company analyzed 73 million reviews in three sectors: home, legal and medical services. Nearly 14% of the reviews were likely fake, and the company expressed a “high degree of confidence” that 2.3 million reviews were partly or entirely AI-generated.
“It’s just a really, really good tool for these review scammers,” said Maury Blackman, an investor and advisor to tech startups, who reviewed The Transparency Company's work and is set to lead the organization starting Jan. 1.
In August, software company DoubleVerify said it was observing a “significant increase” in mobile phone and smart TV apps with reviews crafted by generative AI. The reviews often were used to deceive customers into installing apps that could hijack devices or run ads constantly, the company said.
The following month, the Federal Trade Commission sued the company behind an AI writing tool and content generator called Rytr, accusing it of offering a service that could pollute the marketplace with fraudulent reviews.
The FTC, which this year banned the sale or purchase of fake reviews, said some of Rytr’s subscribers used the tool to produce hundreds and perhaps thousands of reviews for garage door repair companies, sellers of “replica” designer handbags and other businesses.
Max Spero, CEO of AI detection company Pangram Labs, said the software his company uses has detected with almost certainty that some AI-generated appraisals posted on Amazon bubbled up to the top of review search results because they were so detailed and appeared to be well thought-out.
But determining what is fake or not can be challenging. External parties can fall short because they don’t have “access to data signals that indicate patterns of abuse,” Amazon has said.
Pangram Labs has done detection for some prominent online sites, which Spero declined to name due to non-disclosure agreements. He said he evaluated Amazon and Yelp independently.
Many of the AI-generated comments on Yelp appeared to be posted by individuals who were trying to publish enough reviews to earn an “Elite” badge, which is intended to let users know they should trust the content, Spero said.
The badge provides access to exclusive events with local business owners. Fraudsters also want it so their Yelp profiles can look more realistic, said Kay Dean, a former federal criminal investigator who runs a watchdog group called Fake Review Watch.
To be sure, just because a review is AI-generated doesn’t necessarily mean its fake. Some consumers might experiment with AI tools to generate content that reflects their genuine sentiments. Some non-native English speakers say they turn to AI to make sure they use accurate language in the reviews they write.
“It can help with reviews (and) make it more informative if it comes out of good intentions,” said Michigan State University marketing professor Sherry He, who has researched fake reviews. She says tech platforms should focus on the behavioral patters of bad actors, which prominent platforms already do, instead of discouraging legitimate users from turning to AI tools.
Prominent companies are developing policies for how AI-generated content fits into their systems for removing phony or abusive reviews. Some already employ algorithms and investigative teams to detect and take down fake reviews but are giving users some flexibility to use AI.
Spokespeople for Amazon and Trustpilot, for example, said they would allow customers to post AI-assisted reviews as long as they reflect their genuine experience. Yelp has taken a more cautious approach, saying its guidelines require reviewers to write their own copy.
“With the recent rise in consumer adoption of AI tools, Yelp has significantly invested in methods to better detect and mitigate such content on our platform,” the company said in a statement.
The Coalition for Trusted Reviews, which Amazon, Trustpilot, employment review site Glassdoor, and travel sites Tripadvisor, Expedia and Booking.com launched last year, said that even though deceivers may put AI to illicit use, the technology also presents “an opportunity to push back against those who seek to use reviews to mislead others.”
“By sharing best practice and raising standards, including developing advanced AI detection systems, we can protect consumers and maintain the integrity of online reviews,” the group said.
The FTC’s rule banning fake reviews, which took effect in October, allows the agency to fine businesses and individuals who engage in the practice. Tech companies hosting such reviews are shielded from the penalty because they are not legally liable under U.S. law for the content that outsiders post on their platforms.
Tech companies, including Amazon, Yelp and Google, have sued fake review brokers they accuse of peddling counterfeit reviews on their sites. The companies say their technology has blocked or removed a huge swath of suspect reviews and suspicious accounts. However, some experts say they could be doing more.
“Their efforts thus far are not nearly enough,” said Dean of Fake Review Watch. “If these tech companies are so committed to eliminating review fraud on their platforms, why is it that I, one individual who works with no automation, can find hundreds or even thousands of fake reviews on any given day?”
Consumers can try to spot fake reviews by watching out for a few possible warning signs, according to researchers. Overly enthusiastic or negative reviews are red flags. Jargon that repeats a product's full name or model number is another potential giveaway.
When it comes to AI, research conducted by Balázs Kovács, a Yale professor of organization behavior, has shown that people can't tell the difference between AI-generated and human-written reviews. Some AI detectors may also be fooled by shorter texts, which are common in online reviews, the study said.
However, there are some “AI tells” that online shoppers and service seekers should keep it mind. Panagram Labs says reviews written with AI are typically longer, highly structured and include “empty descriptors,” such as generic phrases and attributes. The writing also tends to include cliches like “the first thing that struck me” and “game-changer.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-23,Many Americans have come to rely on Chinese-made drones. Now lawmakers want to ban them,"The economic and technological rivalry between the U.S. and China has come to the drone market, where Chinese-made flying devices are a dominant player in America","WASHINGTON -- Russell Hedrick, a North Carolina farmer, flies drones to spray fertilizers on his corn, soybean and wheat fields at a fraction of what it would cost him to use a conventional ground spreader.
As a volunteer rescuer, Hedrick uses thermal drones to search for people trapped by mudslides and cargo drones to send water and baby formula to those who are stranded — something he did after Hurricane Helene.
Now he is fretting that one day he will have to ground his drone fleet. Most commercial drones sold in the United States, including those used by Hedrick, are made in China. They have become a target of U.S. lawmakers, who see the dominance of Chinese drones not only as an espionage threat but as a commercial threat because they make it nearly impossible for American manufacturers to compete.
It’s another front in the U.S.-China economic and technological competition that’s likely to intensify with the return to the White House in January of Republican Donald Trump, who has promised to get tough on China.
Washington has already placed restrictions on Chinese telecommunications companies and imposed high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles as the U.S. competes with China in semiconductors, artificial intelligence and other areas.
A defense bill that Congress passed on Dec. 18 includes a clause to stop two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review finds they pose “an unacceptable risk” to American national security. Congress has banned federal agencies from acquiring Chinese drones, with some exceptions, and several states have barred publicly funded programs from using or procuring Chinese drones.
A broader ban is worrisome for Americans for whom drones have become a part of their lives and work. It could disrupt wide-ranging operations, from law enforcement to mapping and filmmaking that drone operators say are viable because of the low cost and high performance of the Chinese drones. American-made drones just aren’t comparable, they say.
In Hickory, North Carolina, Hedrick began flying Chinese-made drones in 2019 to fertilize crops and monitor crop health. A drone spreader costs $35,000, while a conventional ground sprayer would set him back $250,000, he said.
“With the drone efficiency, we are able to do things we were never able to do before: to apply fertilizer but use less, which is good for American consumers,” Hedrick said.
But it’s precisely that reliance on Chinese drones that worries U.S. lawmakers.
“It is strategically irresponsible to allow Communist China to be our drone factory,” argued Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who has been tapped by Trump to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. She led earlier House efforts to ban new Chinese drones.
It was the role of drones in everyday life that drove Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., to get Congress to restrict the purchase of Chinese drones by federal agencies. Those restrictions were included in a defense bill that Democratic President Joe Biden signed last year.
Scott has compared Chinese drones to spy balloons that could “gather data or carry harmful payloads” across America, posing risks to military bases, critical infrastructure and natural resources.
Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, an advocacy group for unmanned vehicles such as drones, opposes an immediate ban. Instead, his group has urged the government to support the U.S. drone-making industry through investment so it can catch up with its Chinese competitors in both capability and cost.
He applauds Congress for addressing some of the issues in the 2025 defense budget, including promoting investment in autonomous technology and working to develop a secure supply chain for U.S. drone manufacturing.
That vulnerability was clear earlier this year when Beijing sanctioned the U.S. drone maker Skydio, forcing it to ration its batteries sourced from China.
“This is an attempt to eliminate the leading American drone company and deepen the world’s dependence on Chinese drone suppliers,” wrote Adam Bry, chief executive officer of Skydio.
Citing security interests, China has restricted exports to the U.S. of drone parts, including motors, flight controllers and imaging equipment.
John Goodson, CEO of Darkhive, a San Antonio-based drone maker, said a ban would not stop Chinese drone makers from selling their products elsewhere in the world but could hurt U.S. drone companies that rely on China for parts.
For now, it remains unrealistic to ban Chinese drones when there are few comparable products, said Faine Greenwood, a drone enthusiast who writes extensively about drones. “If we ban the Chinese drones, we knock out many amazing things we do.”
The best-known Chinese drones are those by DJI Technology Co., a company founded in 2006 and based in the southern city of Shenzhen. It's named in the defense spending bill, along with another Chinese company, Autel Robotics.
DJI has the lion's share of the global drone market and is the dominant player in the U.S. market. Its devices are known for their affordability and high performance. They are even used on the battlefield in Ukraine by both sides, even though DJI does not make military drones.
DJI's drones have been used by first responders to locate disaster victims, mappers to survey roads and utility lines, mosquito control officers to reach swarms of larvae, and filmmakers to capture aerial footage. Police use them to help prevent crime and find missing people.
Hedrick, the North Carolina farmer, mobilized drone search efforts as a volunteer after Helene hit. On the first night, he and his teammates located 150 stranded people. When they could not be immediately rescued, Hedrick said his team used DJI cargo drones to send in supplies.
“I am not going to say I won’t love to have U.S. drones, but I don’t see the American drones as anywhere close to the DJI drones in terms of reliability, ease of use, and just the user-friendly software,” Hedrick said. “The U.S. drones are not as good as the DJI ones but cost twice as much.”
But as U.S.-China relations have soured, DJI drones have come under scrutiny. The U.S. government has put the company on several blacklists, saying it violates human rights by supplying drones to Chinese police to surveil members of the ethnic Uyghur minority, and alleging links to the Chinese military.
DJI has denied wrongdoing and is suing the Pentagon over the designation that it is a Chinese military company. U.S. customs officials also have blocked some DJI shipments over concerns that the products might have been made with forced labor. DJI has called it “a customs-related misunderstanding.”
As for the defense bill, DIJ said it contains no provision that would allow the company to defend itself. “We call on a relevant technical intelligence agency to undertake an audit of our products, and we ask for a fair right of reply to any findings,” DJI said.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington said China opposes what it calls the politicization of trade.
“The Chinese government firmly supports Chinese companies in carrying out international trade and cooperation in drones for civilian use, and opposes certain countries’ frequent illegal sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals on the grounds of so-called national security,” Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesman, said in a statement.
Several states have already restricted the use of Chinese drones. In Tennessee, public agencies, including police and fire departments, are no longer allowed to purchase DJI drones.
That caused a headache for Capt. Chris Lowe of the Kingsport Fire Department. After his department lost a DJI Mavic Pro drone, he was quoted $5,000 for a replacement from an approved list of drones, when another DJI Mavic Pro would cost $1,000 to $1,500.
“Basically it would be a DJI clone but doesn’t have all the capabilities,” Lowe said of the alternative. Without any state assistance, he said he would either forgo a new drone or tighten the belt in equipment maintenance elsewhere. He said the department has used drones to scope out wildfires, chemical leaks and disaster scenes and to search for missing people. “It's about life and death,” he said.
In Wimberley, Texas, Gene Robinson has used high-resolution drone images to analyze differences in vegetation to discover buried bodies. He said he helped police find a victim's buried arm, making prosecution possible. Robinson doesn’t think there’s a viable alternative to the DJI drone he uses.
He said his project at Texas State University's Forensic Anthropology Center would be “deader than a doornail” if there's a national ban on Chinese-made drones.
At the Interior Department, the policy against foreign-made drones has hamstrung its drone operations, resulting in the “loss of opportunities to collect data on landscape, natural and cultural resources, wildlife and infrastructure,"" according to a September report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
In Florida, law enforcement officers last year complained to the state senate that a ban on state-funded agencies operating Chinese-made drones left them with costlier aircraft that didn't perform as well. That prompted state lawmakers to appropriate $25 million to help government-run drone programs acquire compliant models.
Christopher Todd, executive director of the not-for-profit group Airborne International Response Team, described the ban and the subsequent switch as “an absolute mess.""
“Lawmakers failed to understand that this issue is far more complicated than simply changing from one drone to another,"" he said. “You need to learn a new user interface with new shortcuts and new protocols, and then you need to change all of the software and accessories and re-examine all of your network configurations to accommodate the technology change.""
But the financial assistance as well as training programs, such as the one provided by his group, made the transition possible, he said.
More than 90% of law enforcement agencies in Florida used DJI drones in 2022, and the share plummeted to about 14% after the ban, according to Todd's group.
In Orange County, where Orlando is located, the sheriff's office said it spent nearly $580,000 to replace 18 noncompliant drones last year and received nearly $400,000 in reimbursements from the state.
“The transition has gone well and has simultaneously increased our drone fleet with better capabilities and technology,” the sheriff's office said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-22,Bluesky finds with growth comes growing pains — and bots,"Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk’s X, or wanting an alternative to Meta’s Threads and its algorithms","Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk's X, which they view as increasingly leaning too far to the right given its owner's support of President-elect Donald Trump, or wanting an alternative to Meta's Threads and its algorithms.
The platform grew out of the company then known as Twitter, championed by its former CEO Jack Dorsey. Its decentralized approach to social networking was eventually intended to replace Twitter's core mechanic. That's unlikely now that the two companies have parted ways. But Bluesky's growth trajectory — with a user base that has more than doubled since October — could make it a serious competitor to other social platforms.
But with growth comes growing pains. It's not just human users who've been flocking to Bluesky but also bots, including those designed to create partisan division or direct users to junk websites.
The skyrocketing user base — now surpassing 25 million — is the biggest test yet for a relatively young platform that has branded itself as a social media alternative free of the problems plaguing its competitors. According to research firm Similarweb, Bluesky added 7.6 million monthly active app users on iOS and Android in November, an increase of 295.4% since October. It also saw 56.2 million desktop and mobile web visits, in the same period, up 189% from October.
Besides the U.S. elections, Bluesky also got a boost when X was briefly banned in Brazil.
“They got this spike in attention, they’ve crossed the threshold where it is now worth it for people to flood the platform with spam,” said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and a member of Issue One’s Council for Responsible Social Media. “But they don’t have the cash flow, they don’t have the established team that a larger platform would, so they have to do it all very, very quickly.”
To manage growth for its tiny staff, Bluesky started as an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other distinctive features to attract new users, such as “starter packs” that provide lists of topically curated feeds. Meta recently announced that it is testing a similar feature.
Compared to the bigger players like Meta's platforms or X, Bluesky has a “quite different” value system, said Claire Wardle, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in misinformation. This includes giving users more control over their experience.
“The first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders,” Bluesky said on its blog in March. “Our online experience doesn’t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.”
Because of this mindset, Bluesky has achieved a scrappy underdog status that has attracted users who've grown tired of the big players.
“People had this idea that it was going to be a different type of social network,” Wardle said. “But the truth is, when you get lots of people in a place and there are eyeballs, it means that it’s in other people’s interests to use bots to create, you know, information that aligns with their perspective.”
Little data has emerged to help quantify the rise in impersonator accounts, artificial intelligence-fueled networks and other potentially harmful content on Bluesky. But in recent weeks, users have begun reporting large numbers of apparent AI bots following them, posting plagiarized articles or making seemingly automated divisive comments in replies.
Lion Cassens, a Bluesky user and doctoral candidate in the Netherlands, found one such network by accident — a group of German-language accounts with similar bios and AI-generated profile pictures posting in replies to three German newspapers.
“I noticed some weird replies under a news post by the German newspaper ‘Die Ziet,’” he said in an email to The Associated Press. “I have a lot of trust in the moderation mechanism on Bluesky, especially compared to Twitter since the layoffs and due to Musk’s more radical stance on freedom of speech. But AI bots are a big challenge, as they will only improve. I hope social media can keep up with that.”
Cassens said the bots' messages have been relatively innocuous so far, but he was concerned about how they could be repurposed in the future to mislead.
There are also signs that foreign disinformation narratives have made their way to Bluesky. The disinformation research group Alethea pointed to one low-traction post sharing a false claim about ABC News that had circulated on Russian Telegram channels.
Copycat accounts are another challenge. In late November, Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, found that of the top 100 most followed named individuals on Bluesky, 44% had at least one duplicate account posing as them. Two weeks later, Mantzarlis said Bluesky had removed around two-thirds of the duplicate accounts he’d initially detected — a sign the site was aware of the issue and attempting to address it.
Bluesky posted earlier this month that it had quadrupled its moderation team to keep up with its growing user base. The company also announced it had introduced a new system to detect impersonation and was working to improve its Community Guidelines to provide more detail on what’s allowed. Because of the way the site is built, users also have the option to subscribe to third-party “Labelers” that outsource content moderation by tagging accounts with warnings and context.
The company didn't respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.
Even as its challenges aren’t yet at the scale other platforms face, Bluesky is at a “crossroads,” said Edward Perez, a board member at the nonpartisan nonprofit OSET Institute, who previously led Twitter’s civic integrity team.
“Whether BlueSky likes it or not, it is being pulled into the real world,” Perez said, noting that it needs to quickly prioritize threats and work to mitigate them if it hopes to continue to grow.
That said, disinformation and bots won't be Bluesky's only challenges in the months and years to come. As a text-based social network, its entire premise is falling out of favor with younger generations. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that only 17% of American teenagers used X, for instance, down from 23% in 2022. For teens and young adults, TikTok, Instagram and other visual-focused platforms are the places to be.
Political polarization is also going against Bluesky ever reaching the size of TikTok, Instagram or even X.
“Bluesky is not trying to be all things to all people,” Wardle said, adding that, likely, the days of a Facebook or Instagram emerging where they're “trying to keep everybody happy” are over. Social platforms are increasingly splintered along political lines and when they aren't — see Meta's platforms — the companies behind them are actively working to de-emphasize political content and news.

2024-12-22,How Maserati's chief designer is bringing out the brand's 'dark side',"""My main obsession is to be respectful to the brand,"" Klaus Busse, head of design at Maserati, told ABC News.","Taking risks and challenging the status quo can make or break an automotive designer. Klaus Busse knows this well. When he took over as Maserati's design chief in 2015, he was given a marque that had survived world wars, achieved racing history and was heralded for its timeless designs.
He was reminded of the brand's ethos: Gran Turismo. Or, in Busse's words, ""A perfect balance of performance and style and comfort.""
Busse is taking that ethos and transforming the 110-year-old brand so it can survive another 100 years. The automaker's thunderous V8 has been replaced with a smaller V6, which Busse says is better than its predecessor. He's designing vehicles that offer sublime performance without the carbon emissions. And he's pushing the boundaries at the highest levels with his unconventional designs.
His first Maserati, the MC20 sports car, drew immediate praise from the brand's followers and industry insiders. Now, he's setting up the company for its next phase -- electrification.
Busse spoke to ABC News about his design goals at the company, why driving a Maserati is a ""hedonistic experience"" and how Maserati has become relevant again to U.S. consumers.
The interview below has been edited for space and clarity.
Q: When you took over the helm of Maserati design in 2015, what was your first task, your first to-do agenda item?
A: Meet the team and introduce yourself to all the projects that are ongoing. Then ask yourself, how do you carry the torch with this amazing brand? What does the future hold for us? What could electrification mean? Connectivity? What's Maserati going to be like in 10 years? Maserati has this amazing history of reinventing itself.
Busse, head of design for Maserati since 2015, said the brand has ""this amazing history of reinventing itself.""
Maserati
Q: How have the design priorities changed at the company?
A: The priorities have not changed. To be a designer at Maserati, you need to understand how to build a car -- I mean a car that knows how to perform. We're here at a racetrack with the MCXtrema hypercar -- the final car looks like the first sketch and that's because we know how these cars work. You need to earn that respect from the engineers and it becomes a mutual respect. I never felt any pushback on the design. Maserati lives through design as much as through performance. These two elements create what we call this concept of Gran Turismo.
The first customer delivery of the MCXtrema took place in August of 2024 at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca.
Maserati
Q: How have you put your personal mark on Maserati?
A: I don't want cars to be remembered by my team. At the end of the day they're Maseratis, not my car. My main obsession is to be respectful to the brand, to carry it forward. We're now at 110 years old. Some of the greatest designers to ever work on cars have designed Maseratis. My main goal is to serve the brand and to have continuity. I also don't want to be too generic.
Q: How has AI helped your team design cars?
A: AI right now accelerates our visualization process. When I was young, it took me a day to prepare a presentation rendering manually. Then with Photoshop I could do it in two hours. Now, AI can interpret [a sketch] as a 3D model and I can present it almost as a movie: going from a sketch to the car rolling through an artificial environment in one day. In the past that would take three months. So it hyper accelerates the process and it allows us to invest in creativity.
AI is just a tool. Our design evolves through recognizing the heritage.
Q: What's the biggest design risk you've taken at Maserati?
A: The biggest design risk? I love that question. I have taken a few risks but I don't think I can talk about them publicly. To create a car, there's a lot of investment involved. The company and the process are set up to eliminate risks. But sometimes I have to provoke to a point where I push myself first, then my team. Because if we only present things that we like today, there's a chance they might get boring too quickly. Design is supposed to be timeless.
Here's one example though. For our electric Gran Turismo, we designed the wheels with a flatter section because it helps us with aerodynamics and it helps with extending the range of the car. That was the first time we did that. We came up with a design that didn't exist on the market. We did a design that was so new and unknown for Maserati. And now two years on the market, I think it's the best wheel we have. It was taking that step ... we were very out of our comfort zone. I am happy with did that and had the courage.
Busse said his team took a risk when designing the wheels on the electric GranTurismo: ""We did a design that was so new and unknown for Maserati.""
Maserati
Then look at the Levante Trofeo, a very aggressive car. When we put this massive [V8] engine in there 10 years ago, I wanted to show a little bit of the dark side of Maserati. At that time we had no matte paint -- our paints were blue and silver. I thought let's do a matte grey -- it was a big deal internally and shows this is a more sinister car. We [at Maserati] try to make the cars running sculptures. They're not ostentatious. We don't do aggressive design, we want people to be appreciate of design. So the matte grey is kinda pushing that.
Busse said he chose a matte grey exterior color for the Levante Trofeo to ""show a little bit of the dark side of Maserati.""
Maserati
Q: There's a lot of industry chatter about screens and the loss of buttons. What's your take? Are automakers welcoming back physical knobs and switches?
A: It's indeed something we're looking very carefully at. We're in touch with our customers and listening to them. In the current generation of cars we launched, we went for more screens for a couple of reasons. There's such a massive leap forward in terms of technology and innovation in the current cars. The screen was the only solution to make this accessible for the customer. If you do everything in physical buttons, it's like a plane cockpit, it's too overwhelming. The screens were super important.
I rejected putting the screen higher up, however. When you drive a Maserati, it's a very hedonistic experience and I want your eyes on the road and not distracted by some kind of graphics. So we moved the screen down so it's not in your face, not the first thing you see when you enter the car. And they're ergonomic -- you don't have to reach up and out of the seat [to touch the screen].
We do embrace screens but we do it in our Maserati way. The driving pleasure is the priority -- not screens that play all kinds of animation.

Q: Talk about the challenges of designing a car that can be sold with an internal combustion engine and an electric battery.
A: That's indeed a challenge. Foremost, you're buying the design of Maserati. You have the choice depending on your lifestyle how you want to use the car. We're not trying to tell you what kind of car you need to live your life. With the GranTurismo, both [electric and ICE] cars look almost identical. We give the customer the choice.
Q: Has the company lost longtime customers who were fans of the mighty V8, which has since been retired?
A: Honestly, I don't know. The V6 replacement is a much better engine than the V8. The V8 had a peak of 430 horsepower. The V6 is 100 hp more. and it's lighter and more compact. And I can put it behind the front axle as a mid-engine and it allows me to do all-wheel drive. The V8 was so heavy and big and you can't do all-wheel drive. You also then have a front-engine car, which is not so good for balance. If we lost customers, it's only because sound is more important than performance. But performance is more important to us than sound. Don't get me wrong, I love my car (a V8 Gran Cabrio). But the V6 is a better engine. The engine is not screaming but you are screaming.

Q: After a vehicle goes through all the approvals and hits the production, are you ever like, I should have smoothed out that line or tweaked that fender? Are you doing revisions in your head even after final production?
A: So in the first half of my career, yes. I would never drive the cars I was responsible for because I always felt I could have done better. We always do the best in the moment at Maserati, and you make peace with that. With every Maserati that comes out I know we did the best in that moment. And I am incredibly proud of those cars. I never look back. There's always the next car and by definition the next car will be better. I am incredibly proud of what my team and the engineers have accomplished. There's nothing I can complain about.
MC20 stands for Maserati Corse 2020 (""Maserati Racing 2020"") and celebrates the brand's racing comeback.
Maserati
Q: Which car are you most proud of at the company?
A: The MC20. It was the first car I was responsible for [as chief of design]. This brand has had the greatest designers that worked this Earth and suddenly you have to do that next step. This car will always be special.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-22,Ex-OpenAI engineer who raised legal concerns about the technology he helped build has died,The whistleblower helped train artificial intelligence systems behind ChatGPT.,"Suchir Balaji, a former OpenAI engineer and whistleblower who helped train the artificial intelligence systems behind ChatGPT and later said he believed those practices violated copyright law, has died, according to his parents and San Francisco officials. He was 26.
Balaji worked at OpenAI for nearly four years before quitting in August. He was well-regarded by colleagues at the San Francisco company, where a co-founder this week called him one of OpenAI's strongest contributors who was essential to developing some of its products.
“We are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news and our hearts go out to Suchir’s loved ones during this difficult time,” said a statement from OpenAI.
Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on Nov. 26 in what police said “appeared to be a suicide. No evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation.” The city's chief medical examiner's office confirmed the manner of death to be suicide.
His parents Poornima Ramarao and Balaji Ramamurthy said they are still seeking answers, describing their son as a “happy, smart and brave young man” who loved to hike and recently returned from a trip with friends.
Balaji grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and first arrived at the fledgling AI research lab for a 2018 summer internship while studying computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. He returned a few years later to work at OpenAI, where one of his first projects, called WebGPT, helped pave the way for ChatGPT.
“Suchir’s contributions to this project were essential, and it wouldn’t have succeeded without him,” said OpenAI co-founder John Schulman in a social media post memorializing Balaji. Schulman, who recruited Balaji to his team, said what made him such an exceptional engineer and scientist was his attention to detail and ability to notice subtle bugs or logical errors.
“He had a knack for finding simple solutions and writing elegant code that worked,” Schulman wrote. “He’d think through the details of things carefully and rigorously.”
Balaji later shifted to organizing the huge datasets of online writings and other media used to train GPT-4, the fourth generation of OpenAI's flagship large language model and a basis for the company's famous chatbot. It was that work that eventually caused Balaji to question the technology he helped build, especially after newspapers, novelists and others began suing OpenAI and other AI companies for copyright infringement.
He first raised his concerns with The New York Times, which reported them in an October profile of Balaji.
He later told The Associated Press he would “try to testify” in the strongest copyright infringement cases and considered a lawsuit brought by The New York Times last year to be the “most serious.” Times lawyers named him in a Nov. 18 court filing as someone who might have “unique and relevant documents” supporting allegations of OpenAI's willful copyright infringement.
His records were also sought by lawyers in a separate case brought by book authors including the comedian Sarah Silverman, according to a court filing.
“It doesn’t feel right to be training on people’s data and then competing with them in the marketplace,” Balaji told the AP in late October. “I don’t think you should be able to do that. I don’t think you are able to do that legally.”
He told the AP that he gradually grew more disillusioned with OpenAI, especially after the internal turmoil that led its board of directors to fire and then rehire CEO Sam Altman last year. Balaji said he was broadly concerned about how its commercial products were rolling out, including their propensity for spouting false information known as hallucinations.
But of the “bag of issues” he was concerned about, he said he was focusing on copyright as the one it was “actually possible to do something about.”
He acknowledged that it was an unpopular opinion within the AI research community, which is accustomed to pulling data from the internet, but said “they will have to change and it’s a matter of time.”
He had not been deposed and it’s unclear to what extent his revelations will be admitted as evidence in any legal cases after his death. He also published a personal blog post with his opinions about the topic.
Schulman, who resigned from OpenAI in August, said he and Balaji coincidentally left on the same day and celebrated with fellow colleagues that night with dinner and drinks at a San Francisco bar. Another of Balaji’s mentors, co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, had left OpenAI several months earlier, which Balaji saw as another impetus to leave.
Schulman said Balaji had told him earlier this year of his plans to leave OpenAI and that Balaji didn't think that better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence “was right around the corner, like the rest of the company seemed to believe.” The younger engineer expressed interest in getting a doctorate and exploring “some more off-the-beaten path ideas about how to build intelligence,” Schulman said.
Balaji's family said a memorial is being planned for later this month at the India Community Center in Milpitas, California, not far from his hometown of Cupertino.

2024-12-21,Italy's privacy watchdog fines OpenAI for ChatGPT's violations in collecting users personal data,Italy’s data protection authority says it has fined OpenAI $15.6 million after wrapping up a probe into the collection of personal data by its generative artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT,"ROME -- Italy’s data protection watchdog said Friday it has fined OpenAI 15 million euros ($15.6 million) after wrapping up a probe into the collection of personal data by the U.S. artificial intelligence company's popular chatbot ChatGPT.
The country’s privacy watchdog, known as Garante, said its investigation showed that OpenAI processed users’ personal data to train ChatGPT “without having an adequate legal basis and violated the principle of transparency and the related information obligations towards users”.
OpenAI dubbed the decision “disproportionate” and said it will appeal.
“When the Garante ordered us to stop offering ChatGPT in Italy in 2023, we worked with them to reinstate it a month later,” an OpenAI spokesperson said Friday in an emailed statement. “They’ve since recognized our industry-leading approach to protecting privacy in AI, yet this fine is nearly 20 times the revenue we made in Italy during the relevant period.”
OpenAI added, however, it remained “committed to working with privacy authorities worldwide to offer beneficial AI that respects privacy rights.”
The investigation, launched last year, also found that OpenAI didn’t provide an “adequate age verification system” to prevent users under 13 years of age from being exposed to inappropriate AI-generated content, the watchdog said.
The Italian authority also ordered OpenAI to launch a six-month campaign on different Italian media to raise public awareness about ChatGPT, specifically in regard to data collection.
The booming popularity of generative artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT has drawn scrutiny from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.
Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have been examining OpenAI and other companies that have played a key part in the AI boom, while governments around the world have been drawing up rules to protect against risks posed by AI systems, led by the European Union's AI Act, a comprehensive rulebook for artificial intelligence.

2024-12-20,Woman paralyzed by fallen tree finds hope with newly FDA-cleared device,"ARC-EX Therapy, an external spinal stimulator, was recently cleared by the FDA.","Nearly 12 years ago, Jessie Owen's life changed forever.
""My family was going over a mountain pass and a tree fell on our car. In that moment, my parents passed away, my siblings were severely injured, and I became quadriplegic,"" Owen said. ""I lost my independence. I lost my job. I lost my apartment. I lost my autonomy and the life that I dreamed for myself.""
Like Owen, more than 300,000 people live with spinal cord injuries in the United States, with an estimated 18,000 new cases each year, data shows.
Motor vehicle accidents account for the majority of spinal cord injuries and are closely followed by falls, acts of violence and sports activities, according to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center.
Jessie Owen was left paralyzed nearly 12 years ago when a tree fell on a car in which she was a passenger.
Jessie Owen
For years, options for recovery have been limited, but a newly FDA-cleared external spinal stimulator, ARC-EX Therapy, which received clearance on Dec. 19, may offer hope for people like Owen.
""ARC-EX is simply electrodes attached to skin on the back of the neck,"" explained Chet Moritz, Ph.D., a professor of rehabilitation medicine at the University of Washington. ""It allows us to pass current through the skin to activate the sensory nerves as they enter the spinal cord. Now, those sensory nerves make direct connections to the motor nerves which help people to move.""

Owen, who participated in the Up-LIFT study, a clinical trial focusing on the health benefits of ARC-EX Therapy, saw a life-changing impact.
""I was wildly surprised and pleased to see that it was making meaningful change in my life. I can now paint with my hands. I can open a jar of peanut butter. I can tie my shoes. It [used to] take me 30 minutes to get dressed. Now it takes 12. [I used to require] 20 caregiving hours a week and I was able to move down to about eight.""

The Up-LIFT study produced promising results.
Of the 60 patients with cervical spinal cord injuries studied, 72% saw improvements in hand strength and function. Participants also reported fewer muscle spasms, better sleep, less pain, and improved independence during daily activities.
""The success of [this] study of people with spinal cord injuries is phenomenal,"" noted Moritz. ""There are essentially no current therapies for chronic spinal cord injury, and so having the majority of patients respond in both strength and function measures [is] just an outstanding result.""

With FDA approval, ARC-EX Therapy is expected to become more accessible.
""Patients can work with their local rehabilitation clinics to see a therapist and work with them in the clinic at first to tune the device,"" Moritz said. Results may appear quickly -- some participants noticed changes within just a few sessions, he added.
While the device is currently cleared for improving hand strength, function and sensation, Moritz noted other benefits: ""Some people will have modest improvements in their bladder function, heart rate, or blood pressure control.""
Leah Croll, M.D., vascular neurologist at Maimonides Health and assistant professor of neurology at SUNY Downstate, shared the excitement over the device.
""The idea that ARC-EX Therapy may accelerate or augment neurologic recovery is really exciting. Any improvement in neurologic function is meaningful and has far-reaching impact in the daily lives of these patients and their families,"" she said.
The road to recovery after a spinal cord injury is grueling, Croll said.
""After emergency and ICU care is completed, the mainstay of treatment is working closely with physical therapists, occupational therapists and other rehabilitation professionals to support neurologic recovery,"" said Croll. ""Patients may also need medications and certain procedures, depending on their unique symptoms.""
For Owen and others, ARC-EX Therapy represents a renewed sense of hope and an exciting change in the way these patients can be treated.
""[With ARC-EX Therapy], I continued to gain function back, and I found I was able to pour more into other people,"" Owen said. ""The first indicator of success that I noticed was my own happiness. It works, and it gives us hope and passion.""

2024-12-20,76ers win city council nod to build $1.3B downtown stadium and leave South Philadelphia,The Philadelphia 76ers have won city council approval for a $1.3 billion downtown arena despite vocal opposition from nearby residents,"PHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia 76ers won city council approval on Thursday for a $1.3 billion downtown arena despite vocal opposition from nearby Chinatown residents and other activists.
Council voted 12-5 to approve the project at a packed meeting at City Hall. Owners of the NBA team hope to move in to 76 Place by 2031. However, opponents say the fight is far from over.
Mayor Cherelle Parker, a Democrat who had championed the plan, said the entire city will benefit from what she called a “historic game-changing economic development project,” according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.
Supporters hope the 18,500-seat arena can help revive a distressed retail corridor called Market East, which runs from City Hall to the Liberty Bell. The area has struggled for years despite several redevelopment efforts.
The team owners, Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, are eager to end their Wells Fargo Center lease with Comcast Spectacor in South Philadelphia. They have pushed for city approval by year’s end so they can meet their target opening date.
They vowed not to ask the city for any construction funding, although they are free to seek state and federal funds. Instead of property taxes, they would pay about $6 million in annual Payments in Lieu of Taxes.
Protesters who locked arms on the council floor and delayed the start of the Thursday’s meeting said they would continue their fight.
“The mayor and City Council kowtowed to the billionaires’ artificial timeline,” said opponent Mohan Seshadri, a member of the No Arena Coalition who also serves as executive director of the Asian Pacific Islander Political Alliance.
Opponents fear the arena will bring gridlock on game days – and go dark at other times – and also bring gentrification and rising rents to the area.
The Chinatown community has fought a series of proposed developments since the 1960s, including casinos, a prison, a baseball stadium and a highway, the last of which dissected the neighborhood when it opened in 1991.
Council members on Thursday approved 11 bills that address zoning changes, land transfers, public safety and other issues to accommodate the 76ers' plan.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-19,"Harmful gas billowing from Texas and New Mexico comes mostly from smaller leaks, researchers say","Huge quantities of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, are being emitting by oil and gas operators in the 75,000-square-mile Permian Basin straddling Texas and New Mexico","The blob on the satellite image is a rainbow of colors. An analyst digitally sharpens it and there, highlighted in red, is the source: a concrete oil pad spewing methane.
In the 75,000-square-mile (194-square-kilometer) Permian Basin straddling Texas and New Mexico, the most productive oil and gas region in the world, huge amounts of the powerful greenhouse gas escape from wells, compressor stations and other equipment.
Most efforts to reduce emissions have focused on so-called “super emitters” like the one in the satellite image, which are relatively easy to find with improving satellite imaging and other aerial sensing.
Now researchers say much smaller sources are collectively responsible for about 72% of methane emissions from oil and gas fields throughout the contiguous U.S. These have often gone undetected.
“It's really (important to) approach the problem from both ends because the high-emitting super emitters are important, but so are the smaller ones,” said James Williams, a post-doctoral science fellow at the Environmental Defense Fund and lead author on a new study that took a comprehensive look at emissions within the nation's oil and gas basins.
Addressing methane is important because it accounts for about one third of all greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.
Tackling methane emissions in the Permian is especially challenging because there are more than 130,000 active well sites owned by everyone from family operators to international conglomerates, experts said. Each site can have multiple oil wells.
“The Permian is in many ways the most complicated basin in the world; it’s incredibly dense there ... with big, small and everything in between,” said Steve Hamburg, chief scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund.
What’s more, pipelines, processing and other activities often are owned by different companies — with tens of thousands of points where methane might escape, either through leaks or intentional venting.
An Israeli company that used satellite data and artificial intelligence to look for leaks in Midland County, Texas, the heart of the Permian Basin, found 50 separate plumes emanating from 16 of 30 sites it monitored. Most were bleeding over 4,500 kilograms of harmful gas per hour and five exceeded 10,000, far above the Environmental Protection Agency's super emitter threshold of 100 kg/hr.
But the biggest surprise, “was seeing a lot of small emissions in this very crowded place ... so close to each other, so close to an area where people actually live,” said Omer Shenhar, vice president of product at Momentick, which provides satellite-based monitoring to oil and gas companies.
Methane traps over 80 times more heat close to the Earth than carbon dioxide does, ton for ton. What’s more, concentrations have almost tripled since pre-industrial times.
A powerful new satellite called MethaneSAT that launched this year will be able to detect small emissions over wide areas that other satellites can't. Researchers will also be able to track methane over time in all the world's major oil-producing basins.
“We've never had that,” said the EDF's Hamburg, who leads the project.
Although the satellite cannot pinpoint those smaller sources, “you don't need to” because operators on the ground can find the sources, Hamburg said.
In the U.S., oil and gas companies will be required to routinely look for leaks at new and existing sites, including from wells, production facilities and compressor station under a new EPA rule.
The rule also phases out the practice of routinely burning off excess methane, called flaring, and requires upgrading devices that leak methane.
States have until 2026 to develop a plan to implement that rule for existing sources.
Oil and natural gas companies also would have to pay a federal fee per ton of leaked methane above a certain level under a final rule announced last month by the Biden administration, although the incoming Trump administration could eliminate that.
Methane — the primary component of natural gas — is valuable commercially, yet many operators in the Permian regard it as a nuisance byproduct of oil production and flare it because they haven't built pipelines to carry it to market, Duren and Hamburg said.
Neither the Permian Basin Petroleum Association nor the U.S. Oil & Gas Association responded to requests for comment.
Riley Duren, CEO of the nonprofit Carbon Mapper, who was not involved in the study, said it's always important to tackle super emitters because they have such an outsize impact. They are often fleeting but not always. Some continue for weeks, months or years.
Everything adds up.
“I think ... what percentage of the total comes from a large number of small sources versus super emitters is less important than what do you do with the information,” said Duren. There are “literally thousands and thousands of pieces of equipment and they can blow a leak at any time.”

2024-12-19,"For airports, background music no longer is an afterthought",Background music is no longer an afterthought at many airports,"SEATAC, Washington -- Background music is no longer an afterthought at many airports, which are hiring local musicians and carefully curating playlists to help lighten travelers’ moods.
London’s Heathrow Airport built a stage to showcase emerging British performers for the first time this summer. The program was so successful the airport hopes to bring it back in 2025. Nashville International Airport has five stages that host more than 800 performances per year, from country musicians to jazz combos. In the Dominican Republic, Punta Cana International Airport greets passengers with live merengue music.
Tiffany Idiart and her two nieces were delighted to hear musicians during a recent layover at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
“I like it. There’s a lot of people here and they can all hear it,” said Grace Idiart, 9. “If their flight got delayed or something like that, they could have had a hard day. And so the music could have made them feel better.”
Airports are also carefully curating their recorded playlists. Detroit Metro Airport plays Motown hits in a tunnel connecting its terminals. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas has a playlist of local artists compiled by an area radio station. Singapore’s Changi Airport commissioned a special piano accompaniment for its giant digital waterfall.
Music isn’t a new phenomenon in airport terminals. Brian Eno’s “Music for Airports,” an album released in 1978, helped define the ambient music genre. It’s minimalist and designed to calm.
But Barry McPhillips, the head of international creative for Mood Media, which provides music for airports and other public spaces, said technology is enabling background music to be less generic and more tailored to specific places or times of day.
Mood Media – formerly known as Muzak – develops playlists to appeal to business travelers or families depending on who’s in the airport at any given time. It might program calmer music in the security line but something more energizing in the duty-free store.
“We see it as a soundscape,” McPhillips said. “We design for all of these moments.”
There’s a science to Mood Music’s decisions on volume, tempo, even whether to play a song in a major key versus a minor one, he added.
“How do we want to affect their mood at that moment?” McPhillips said. “It’s not just like, ‘Here’s a load of songs.’ It’s a load of songs for that 10-minute segment, and then we move to the next 10 minutes.”
At the same time, many airports are going low-tech, hiring local musicians to serenade travelers and give them a sense of the place they’re passing through.
Chicago’s O’Hare and Midway airports have more than 100 live performances each year. Phoenix’s Sky Harbor International Airport began a live music program five years ago and now has two stages featuring local artists.
Tami Kuiken, the manager of airport music in Seattle, said the Seattle-Tacoma airport launched its live music program about a decade ago after a city commissioner heard live music at the airport in Austin, Texas.
“The idea was like, ’Man, why doesn’t Seattle have music? We’re a music city too,” Kuiken said.
At first, the airport created a playlist featuring emerging artists along with famous ones like Pearl Jam. Then it decided to try live musicians for a 12-week trial. It was so successful that the airport now features live musicians daily and is building new performance spaces.
“People’s anxiety levels are very high when they’re traveling,” Kuiken said. “The feedback that we started getting was that once they got through the checkpoint and they were greeted with music, all of a sudden their anxiety and stress levels dropped.”
The programs also benefit musicians, who get paid to perform and gain wider exposure. When Colorado Springs Airport announced a live music program in March, more than 150 musicians applied. It now hosts two two-hour performances each week.
David James, a singer and guitarist who plays at Seattle’s airport about once a week, said waking up in time for a daytime gig took some adjustment. But he’s gained new fans from all over the world.
“I get really sweet responses from people all the time, saying, ‘That was so soothing to be able to just sit and listen to music in between flights,’” James said. “So it feels like it’s especially therapeutic for people.”
Country stars like Blake Shelton and Keith Urban have come through Nashville's airport and interacted with local musicians, said Stacey Nickens, the airport's vice president of corporate communications and marketing. Shelton even gave one his guitar.
Otto Stuparitz, a musicologist and lecturer at the University of Amsterdam who has studied airport music, said airports should think carefully about their selections. Music that’s meant to be actively listened to – like live music or catchy pop songs – can be very distracting in an already chaotic environment, he said. He has noticed some airports – especially in Europe -- turning off piped melodies altogether.
But McPhillips said big spaces like airports can feel cold and unwelcoming without background music.
“A well-crafted audio strategy is one that people aren’t particularly cognizant of,” he said. “They just know they’re having a good time and that it’s appropriate.”

Durbin reported from Detroit.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-19,Ireland embraced data centers that the AI boom needs. Now they're consuming too much of its energy,Dozens of massive data centers are consuming more electricity than all of the urban homes in Ireland and starting to wear out the warm welcome that brought them here,"CLONDALKIN, Ireland -- Dozens of massive data centers humming at the outskirts of Dublin are consuming more electricity than all of the urban homes in Ireland and starting to wear out the warm welcome that brought them here.
Now, a country that made itself a computing factory for Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok is wondering whether it was all worth it as tech giants look around the world to build even more data centers to fuel the next wave of artificial intelligence.
Fears of rolling blackouts led Ireland's grid operator to halt new data centers near Dublin until 2028. These huge buildings and their powerful computers last year consumed 21% of the nation’s electricity, according to official records. No other country has reported a higher burden to the International Energy Agency.
Not only that, but Ireland is still heavily reliant on burning fossil fuels to generate electricity, despite a growing number of wind farms sprouting across the countryside. Further data center expansion threatens Ireland's goals to sharply cut planet-warming emissions.
Ireland is a “microcosm of what many countries could be facing over the next decade, particularly with the growth of AI,” said energy researcher Paul Deane of University College Cork.
Twenty-six-year-old activist Darragh Adelaide lives in a working-class Dublin suburb just across a busy motorway from Grange Castle Business Park, one of Ireland’s biggest data center clusters. It could get even bigger were Adelaide not a thorn in the side of Google’s expansion plans.
“It’s kind of an outrageous number of data centers,” Adelaide said. “People have started to make the connection between the amount of electricity they’re using and electricity prices going up.”
Ireland has attracted global tech companies since the “Celtic Tiger” boom at the turn of the 21st century. Tax incentives, a highly skilled, English-speaking workforce and the country’s membership in the European Union have all contributed to making the tech sector a central part of the Irish economy. The island is also a node for undersea cables that extend to the U.S., Britain, Iceland and mainland Europe.
Nearly all of the data centers sit on the edge of Dublin, where their proximity to the capital city facilitates online financial transactions and other activities that require fast connections. Data center computers run hot, but compared to other parts of the world, Ireland's cool temperatures make it easier to keep them from overheating without drawing in as much water.
Still, buildings that for years went mostly unnoticed have attracted unwanted attention as their power demands surged while Irish householders pay some of Europe’s highest electricity bills. Ireland’s Environmental Protection Agency has also flagged concerns about nitrogen oxide pollution from data centers’ on-site generators — typically gas or diesel turbines — affecting areas near Dublin.
A crackdown began in 2021, spurred by projections that data centers are on pace to take up one third of Ireland's electricity in this decade. Regulators declared that Dublin had hit its limits and could no longer plug more data centers into its grid. The government urged tech companies to look outside the capital and find ways to supply their own power.
“What’s happening in Ireland is the politics of basically what happens when you build too many of these things,” said University College Dublin researcher Patrick Brodie. “Even though people have recognized for a while that data centers are energy hogs, there hasn’t really been so many of these moments where, effectively, Ireland issued a red alert.”
Adelaide was a child when Microsoft opened Grange Castle's first data center in 2009, but enormous complexes built by Amazon, Google, Microsoft and other companies have since expanded around the ruined castle that anchors the business park. They have their own modern fortifications of high fences, surveillance cameras and guard houses, and don’t display their corporate logos.
In June, Adelaide’s campaign against data centers helped get him elected to a seat on the South Dublin County Council for the leftist People Not Profits Party. The council soon after rejected Google’s plan to build another data center. Google appealed the decision in September.
“It was only going to employ around 50 people,” Adelaide said. “It would have been a massive cost to the local area and to Ireland in general with very little benefit, which is kind of how the tax haven system works.”
The backlash from Dublin-area local planning authorities — combined with stricter, if sometimes contradictory, guidance from the national government — has frustrated data center developers.
One fully-built data center from Texas-based Digital Realty is sitting idle at Grange Castle while it awaits permission to connect to the electricity grid. The company sells space within its data centers for clients such as banks, email providers and social media platforms. It says it lacks a grid connection despite contracting for enough renewable energy to power all of its Irish data centers.
“When we look at artificial intelligence, when we look at new technologies coming along the line, the basic requirement for all of those is power infrastructure,” said Dermot Lahey, who directs Digital Realty's data center implementation in Ireland, speaking inside a cavernous empty data hall. Ireland has all the elements to make it a “great home for AI expansion,” he said.
“What’s preventing us from being able to leverage that is the fact that the power constraints that we have, or the power moratorium that we have, is greatly impacting our ability to provide space for customers,” Lahey said.
Once colder weather sets in, the smoky fragrance of fireplaces burning briquettes of peat lingers over County Offaly, just over an hour’s drive west of Dublin in a region known as the Midlands. It’s places like this where some data center developers, thwarted by Dublin’s constraints, now see opportunity.
A report commissioned by County Offaly’s government pitches the bog-dotted region as a place to “create thousands of green jobs” and rival “Dublin, Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam and Paris in being an anchor for data centres powered by renewable energy.”
Farmer and conservationist Brian Sheridan, 83, is doubtful. He's seen this region transformed once before, from a vast wetland known as the Bog of Allen to barren pockets of brownfields as people cut away trenches of dense peat soil, or turf – first with spades and later with tractors at an industrial scale to create homegrown fuel.
“The bog started disappearing and it wasn't being replaced,” said Sheridan, walking along a boardwalk over carpets of moss and sedges in the now-protected Clara Bog Nature Reserve.
Decades of rapid extraction fostered Ireland's energy independence and employed scores of workers in turf-cutting, briquette factories and power plants. But it also polluted the air and devastated a delicate environment. Bogs that naturally trapped large amounts of carbon dioxide were stripped down to the bedrock, contributing to global warming. When burned, peat is dirtier than coal.
Ireland has largely banned the sale of peat and shuttered the last remaining peat-fired power plants. But the state-supported company at the helm of peat extraction, Bord na Móna, still controls vast tracts of former bogland. It has refashioned itself as a renewable energy provider, laying down wind turbines and solar farms and partnering with Amazon to build a data center near the village of Rhode.
Bord na Móna declined multiple interview requests about its plans, and some residents feel left in the dark.
“Bord na Móna, as far as I’m concerned, are a law unto themselves,” Sheridan said. “Now that the turf-cutting is all finished, they should be gone. But it’s still the same Bord Na Móna and they won’t answer questions.”
Amazon declined to talk about specific projects and has repeatedly signaled it may shift its new data center investments away from Ireland. But an executive said the company is still working closely with the Irish government and characterized Ireland’s challenges as mostly about transmission — building the infrastructure to get new clean energy where it needs to go.
“Ireland has tremendous opportunity for additional renewable energy,” said Kevin Miller, Amazon Web Services’ vice president of global data centers. ""However, they also need quite a bit more capacity on the grid to tap into that generation.”
A tech-driven race is on to harness the region's wind. Backed by a power purchase agreement with Microsoft, the Norwegian wind energy company Statkraft is building nine towering wind turbines in remote former boglands along County Offaly’s eastern edge. Statkraft’s managing director for Ireland, Kevin O’Donovan, said data centers are actually helping to accelerate Ireland’s clean energy transition.
“For a lot of the mainland European countries, demand is going down and that’s actually leading to a challenge to roll out renewables,” O’Donovan said. “Whereas in Ireland we have demand that’s increasing because the country is growing economically and obviously a part of that is the data center growth.”
On the other side of Offaly, a group of residents who live along the Lemanaghan Bog near the site of a 7th-century monastery are skeptical of such claims. They are opposed to what a proposed Bord Na Móna wind farm will do to its cultural heritage and ecology.
KK Kenny took his concerns to Dublin this fall in a meeting with the country’s taoiseach, or prime minister, Simon Harris. Kenny wants to see the bog preserved for biodiversity. He'd be happy to see data center developers follow through with their pledge to look to other European countries.
“They say, oh, they’re going to pull out,"" Kenny said. ""That would be a great thing. We can’t sustain them.”
Some neighbors of Amazon's proposed data center in Rhode are more open to the idea. One village resident already commutes all the way to Dublin to work at a data center. Another is hoping it will employ people who’d want to buy new homes.
“We’re all for change,” said Gerard Whelan. “I’ll get work because I build houses. It’s a domino effect.”
At a village pub, the Rhode Inn, Whelan points to a photograph of the old peat-burning power plant where his father worked the control room. Its cooling towers loomed over the village before their demolition two decades ago. Another nearby plant only stopped burning peat a year ago.
What happens next for Ireland's data centers could depend in part on the new national government coming into power early next year.
Data centers were not a top issue for Irish voters who showed up to the polls on Nov. 29. But analysts expect the two center-right parties forming a new coalition government to face industry pressure to ease limits on data center expansion.
Ossian Smyth, an outgoing minister of state for the Irish government whose Green Party lost nearly all its parliamentary seats, said it would be a mistake to slow down Ireland's climate commitments. But he also sees the limits on data center growth set by his outgoing government as having resolved most people's concerns.
What other countries can learn from Ireland's experience, he added, is to carefully manage the effect of data centers on the stability of the electricity system — and make sure their benefits are much more than income or foreign investment.
“Don’t see them as a necessary evil or something that you just have to put up with because it makes money and it gets taxes,” Smyth said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-19,Blinken announces aid for Sudan and talks about AI risks at UN Security Council,Secretary of State Antony Blinken has announced $200 million in humanitarian aid for conflict-torn Sudan during his likely final trip to the United Nations while in office,"UNITED NATIONS -- Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $200 million in humanitarian aid for conflict-torn Sudan during what is likely his final trip to the United Nations while in office.
With the U.N. Security Council more divided than ever, Blinken led two meetings of the U.N.’s most powerful body on Thursday, capping his engagements with the world body after a tumultuous four years that saw war return to Europe and multiple crises in the Middle East.
But neither will focus on Russia’s war with Ukraine or the Mideast, where the U.S. has been frequently at odds with permanent members China and Russia and almost always in the minority when it comes to Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza.
Instead, in an apparent bid to produce a modicum of consensus, Blinken is leading Security Council sessions on artificial intelligence and Sudan, where conflict has sparked a dire humanitarian crisis that aid agencies say has not received enough attention.
The money announced by Blinken will for food, shelter and health care for people Sudan. He also said the State Department will work with Congress to provide an additional $30 million to elevate civilian voices to help with the transition back to democratic governance.
Here’s a look at America's top diplomat at the U.N.:
Blinken has been appearing in person and virtually before the Security Council since March 2021, just after assuming his position as the Biden administration’s top diplomat.
In addition to several one-off council meetings, including one in February 2022 shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine, Blinken has gone to New York for a week every September for the annual General Assembly gathering of world leaders.
The presidency of the Security Council rotates alphabetically every month among its 15 members. This month, it's the U.S. turn.
The country holding the presidency almost always organizes several signature events on topics its government chooses. Presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers often preside at these meetings, which ministers from other council nations are invited to attend.
Russia and China have blocked all council action condemning the invasion of Ukraine.
This has led U.S. officials to believe that a session on the topic, especially as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office with a stated goal of ending the war immediately, would likely be a waste of time.
On the Middle East, the U.S. has frequently vetoed council action condemning Israel for its tactics against Hamas in Gaza, leaving it virtually alone at the United Nations in supporting Israel.
War broke out in Sudan last year between rival generals heading the military and paramilitary forces. The fighting has left tens of thousands dead, forced millions from their homes and pushed a large swath of Sudan’s population to starvation — creating an often forgotten global crisis the U.S. is seeking to spotlight.
The roughly $230 million in assistance announced Thursday brings total U.S. support to over $2.3 billion since the fighting erupted.
Sudan “is facing one of the most dire humanitarian crises on the face of the planet,” State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters Wednesday.
“And so anything we can do to continue to work with partners at the U.N. and otherwise to shed light on that, figure out what ways we can continue to unearth and solidify humanitarian corridors and continue to push for a political solution, that’s absolutely a priority for us and we will continue to use ways to elevate that,” he said.
The U.S. leads the world in developing AI technology, according to a recently released Stanford University index, and it has been in the forefront of U.N. action on AI.
In March, the first U.N. resolution on artificial intelligence was adopted by the 193-member General Assembly. Sponsored by the U.S., it gives global support to an international effort to ensure the powerful technology benefits all nations, respects human rights and is “safe, secure and trustworthy.”
Blinken said AI has the potential to do “tremendous good” but can also pose “tremendous threats to the international peace and security that this council is charged with upholding.”
He noted that “repressive regimes are using AI-enabled surveillance to target journalists and political dissidents"" and that ""if algorithms are built into weapon systems, and if they malfunction, they could spark a conflict.”
“By setting rules of the road for AI we can minimize these risks, we can harness the exceptional promise of this technology,” he said.
Blinken has represented the U.S. at the Security Council about half a dozen times at meetings ranging from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to the war in Gaza.
Russia, like the U.S. and China, is a permanent veto-holding member of the 15-nation council, and both have seats at its horseshoe-shaped table.
But apart from pointed disagreements during debates, there have been no confrontations or one-on-one meetings between Blinken and Russian diplomats at previous U.N. meetings — and there was none on Thursday.
Blinken thanked Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia after his remarks — as is custom — even though Nebenzia accused the U.S. of imposing rules on others but not abiding by them. But the Russian envoy agreed that “we cannot allow AI to dominate human beings and human values.”
It is not unusual for Blinken or other senior U.S. officials to attend international meetings and conferences where Russian officials are present, but interactions are rare.

2024-12-19,Senate passes defense bill that will raise troop pay and aims to counter China's power,The Senate has passed a defense bill that authorize significant pay raises for junior enlisted service members and boost overall military spending to $895 billion,"WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed a defense bill Wednesday that authorizes significant pay raises for junior enlisted service members, aims to counter China's growing power and boosts overall military spending to $895 billion while also stripping coverage of transgender medical treatments for children of military members.
The annual defense authorization bill usually gains strong bipartisan support and has not failed to pass Congress in nearly six decades, but the Pentagon policy measure in recent years has become a battleground for cultural issues. Republicans this year sought to tack on to the legislation priorities for social conservatives, contributing to a months-long negotiation over the bill and a falloff in support from Democrats.
Still, the bill passed comfortably 85-14, sending it to President Joe Biden. Eleven senators who caucus with Democrats, as well as three Republicans, voted against the legislation.
The bill ""isn't perfect, but it still includes some very good things that Democrats fought for,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a floor speech. “It has strong provisions to stand up against the Chinese Communist Party here on a national security basis.”
In the House, a majority of Democrats voted against the bill last week after House Speaker Mike Johnson insisted on adding the provision to ban the military health system from providing transgender medical care for children. The legislation easily passed by a vote of 281-140.
Senate Republican leaders argued that its 1% increase for defense spending was not enough, especially at a time of global unrest and challenges to American dominance. Senate Republicans had argued for a generational boost to defense spending this year, but are planning another push for more defense funding once they control the White House and Congress next year.
“We are currently experiencing the most dangerous national security moments since World War II,” said Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, who will chair the Senate Armed Services Committee next year. He has pushed for larger boosts to defense funding that would break spending caps that were agreed to in the bipartisan deal to suspend the nation's debt ceiling last year.
The annual defense authorization bill directs key Pentagon policy, but it would still need to be backed up with an appropriations package.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said in a floor speech this week that without the topline increase “major bill provisions like a pay raise for enlisted servicemembers will come at the expense of investments in the critical weapons systems and munitions that deter conflict and keep them safe.”
The legislation provides for a 14.5% pay raise for junior enlisted service members and a 4.5% increase for others. Lawmakers said those were key to improving the quality of life of service members at a time when many military families rely on food banks and other government assistance programs to make ends meet.
“It includes major quality of life improvements, enhancing things like childcare, housing, medical services, employment support for military spouses and much more,” said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Tucked into the defense bill was also a provision to eliminate a roughly $100-a-month cut in unemployment and sickness benefits for the some 200,000 rail workers nationwide. The benefits are entirely paid for through workers’ wages, but got caught up in previous budget cuts. In a rare move, the railroads joined with their unions to lobby for the change.
The legislation also directs resources towards a more confrontational approach to China, including establishing a fund that could be used to send military resources to Taiwan in much the same way that the U.S. has backed Ukraine. It also invests in new military technologies, including artificial intelligence, and bolsters the U.S. production of ammunition.
The U.S. has also moved in recent years to ban the military from purchasing Chinese products, and the defense bill extended that with prohibitions on Chinese goods from garlic in military commissaries to drone technology.
The Chinese foreign ministry responded to that move last week by calling the bans laughable.
“I don’t think it could ever occur to garlic that it would pose a ‘major threat’ to the U.S.,” said Mao Ning, a ministry spokeswoman. “From drones to cranes, from refrigerators to garlic, more and more Chinese-made products have been accused by the US of ‘posing national security risks’. But has the US shown any reliable evidence or rationale to back up those accusations?”
But in Congress, Republican and Democratic lawmakers have been mostly united in their stance that China is a rising threat. Instead, it was culture war issues that divided lawmakers on the bill, which took months to negotiate.
The Republican-controlled House had passed a version of the bill in June that would have banned the Defense Department's policy of reimbursing costs for service members who travel to another state for an abortion, ended gender affirming care for transgender troops and weeded out diversity initiatives in the military.
Most of those provisions did not make it into the final package, though Republicans are expecting Donald Trump to make sweeping changes to Pentagon policy when he enters office in January.
The bill also still prohibits funding for teaching critical race theory in the military and prohibits TRICARE health plans from covering gender dysphoria treatment for children under 18 if that treatment could result in “sterilization.”
Mike Zamore, the director of policy and government affairs at the American Civil Liberties Union, urged Biden to veto the bill, saying it was “forcing thousands of active-duty service members to choose between their careers in the military and the future of their transgender children.”
In a floor speech, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said she has always voted for the NDAA, but would not do so this year. She said that the policy change for transgender children would affect between 6,000 and 7,000 families, according to estimates her office has received.
“The NDAA has embodied the idea that there is more that brings us together than separates us, that our service members and national defense are not to be politicized. That we put our country over a party when the chips are on the table,"" she said. “Unfortunately, this year that was ignored — all to gut the rights of our service members to get the health care they need for their children.”

2024-12-18,"Musk and Trump are viewed roughly the same by Americans, an AP-NORC poll finds",Elon Musk’s attachment to President-elect Donald Trump has created an unprecedented alliance between America’s most powerful politician and its richest businessman,"WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — Elon Musk, clad in tuxedo and black tie, took the stage at President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort shortly after the election with all the swagger of the winning candidate himself.
“The public has given us a mandate that could not be more clear, the clearest mandate. The people have spoken. The people want change,"" Musk told the audience of Trump's biggest donors, campaign leaders and appointment seekers. “We are going to shake things up. It's going to be a revolution.”
Musk's attachment to Trump has created an alliance between America's most powerful politician and its richest businessman — and roughly the same percentages of Americans have favorable views of each, according to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
Experts are split on whether that overlap in public opinion is a good or bad thing for Musk’s businesses or for Trump’s politics. But it could have far-reaching effects in both realms.
Musk, whose net worth tops $400 billion, oversees six businesses while continuing to work closely with Trump: electric car manufacturer Tesla, the X social media platform, space technology company SpaceX, brain link company Neuralink, the startup xAI and tunneling operator The Boring Co.
“Even though there’s a negative impact, in terms of potentially alienating some of their customers that might not be fans of Trump, the benefits far outweigh any negatives when it comes to having a right-hand seat next to Trump in the White House,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.
Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, identified himself as an investor in Musk's Tesla and a driver of Tesla’s new Cybertruck, the futuristic pickup that has gotten huge amounts of attention but also been the subject of safety concerns and multiple recalls.
“Having your CEO not working at your company and working at the job of having to fire government employees ... as a shareholder, I’m paying someone to not work for my company,” he said. “As a Cybertruck owner with self-driving that sucks and doesn’t work, I’m like, ‘Dude, this isn’t fair.’”
But despite his skepticism, Gerber said he won’t stop investing in Musk’s businesses.
“I’ve made a lot of money with Elon,” he said. “I’m not in the business of investing based on the popularity of CEOs.”
Musk doesn’t appear to give Trump much boost with people who don’t back the incoming president.
He is no more popular with the U.S. public than the president-elect himself, and viewed unfavorably by about half of Americans, according to the AP-NORC poll.
About 4 in 10 Americans have a somewhat or very favorable view of the world’s richest person, very similar to the percentage who view Trump positively. Likewise, about half of adults have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Musk — again, similar to Trump.
Instead, said one political strategist, Musk is the ideal validator for someone who cultivates an image of success in business and who has stocked his Cabinet and key adviser roles with billionaires.
""Trump has always pushed this narrative that he’s a successful developer and a very successful businessman. I think having Musk with him is his double-down on this business success, good-for-the-economy, good-for-everybody-making money kind of persona,” said Christine Matthews, a national political pollster who has worked for Republicans. “In this case, Musk is seen as this successful, innovative, tech entrepreneur, frontier-buster.”
Musk also has at his disposal X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that he purchased and turned into a megaphone for conservative ideas. And having spent an estimated $250 million to support Trump in the election, Musk has signaled he is willing to back Republican primary challenges to GOP members in the House and Senate seeking reelection in 2026 who waver on Trump's appointments and agenda.
Trump has tasked him with leading a group to reduce the size of the federal government and reduce the rulemaking authority of the federal bureaucracy.
Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump’s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.
Some analysts believe the billionaire’s role will create a very friendly landscape for Tesla over the coming years. Ives, the analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Musk’s relationship with Trump could “revolutionize the Tesla story, especially around robotics, AI and autonomous.”
Investors, he said, are betting on Musk and see his political ascent as a “champagne moment.” Unlike Gerber, Ives believes that ending the EV credit and taking subsidies from Detroit carmakers, Hyundai and other companies will create only opportunity for Tesla.
“I think Wall Street is starting to fully digest the potential benefits from Musk,” Ives said.
Tesla’s stock price has nearly doubled since Trump’s victory, creating an additional $750 billion shareholder wealth in the past six weeks. But Gerber feels that jump is because investors believe Tesla will have an advantage when it comes to autonomous driving because Trump could grant the company a national autonomy license.
Still, he thinks Tesla will be the “big loser” of Musk’s businesses because of Trump’s promise to end the EV tax credit for carmakers.
“For Tesla, I don’t see a ton of benefit from this,” he said. “Elon is misleading people to say it hurts the competition if the credit goes away.”
Musk’s other companies — including his artificial intelligence company, xAI — could reap the benefits of working within the Trump administration, he said.
“AI is a transformative investment that will create lots of regulatory and governmental issues, especially around safety and information,” Gerber said. “There’s a lot of benefit, from an AI perspective, to having Elon where he is.”
The relationship between the two men has no parallel in U.S. history, said David Nasaw, biographer of American business tycoons Andrew Carnegie and William Randolph Hearst. He noted that Musk, to a level unlike other tycoons, has relied on subsidies and favorable government decisions for his success from Tesla to SpaceX.
“He’s a unicorn,” Nasaw said of Musk.

2024-12-18,Trump has tapped an unprecedented 13 billionaires for his administration. Here's who they are,"President-elect Donald Trump has assembled the wealthiest presidential administration in modern history, with at least 13 billionaires set to take top government posts.","President-elect Donald Trump has assembled the wealthiest presidential administration in modern history, with at least 13 billionaires set to take on government posts.
They include a wrestling magnate, a private space pioneer, a New York real estate developer, the heir to a small appliance empire, and the wealthiest man on the planet -- with several being donors and close personal friends of the incoming president.
In total, the combined net worth of the wealthiest members of his administration could surpass $460 billion, including Department of Government Efficiency co-head Elon Musk -- whose net worth of more than $400 billion exceeds the GDP of mid-sized countries.
MORE: Trump and giveaways: What Musk spent $270M on during the election
Even discounting Musk, Trump's cabinet is still expected to be the wealthiest in history, with reported billionaires Howard Lutnick nominated as commerce secretary, Linda McMahon nominated as education secretary, and Scott Bessent nominated as treasury secretary. Together, Trump's expected cabinet is worth at least $7 billion.
Trump's ambassador picks also include several billionaires, including financier Warren Stephens, who has been tapped to serve as the ambassador to the United Kingdom, Conair executive Leandro Rizzuto Jr., tapped to serve as the ambassador to the Organization of American States, Charles Kushner, named the ambassador to France, and Tom Barrack, named the ambassador to Turkey.
""It's not a surprise that [Trump] surrounds himself with people who come from the same world that he does,"" said Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications for the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""The billionaire class of businessmen is who he is and who he wants to be seen as, and who he wants to be seen with.""
The wealth of Trump's current cabinet rivals only that of his first-term cabinet -- which had a combined net worth of $3.2 billion -- and dwarfs the $118 million combined net worth of President Joe Biden's cabinet.

During Trump's first term, his secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, boasted the highest net worth, with Forbes estimating it to be roughly $2 billion. In contrast, the wealthiest official in the Biden administration is White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, whose disclosures from 2021 showed his net worth ranging between $90 million and $443 million.
While it's common for people with careers in business to serve in government, watchdog groups told ABC News that ultra-rich individuals with complex financial backgrounds and previous business dealings raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest.
""Being wealthy by itself is not a disqualifier,"" said Kedric Payne, senior director of Ethics at Campaign Legal Center, formerly deputy chief counsel of the Office of Congressional Ethics. ""It's just simply the potential conflicts of interest that are the concern.""
""The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, and his Cabinet picks reflect his priority to put America First,"" Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told ABC News. ""President Trump will continue to appoint highly-qualified men and women who have the talent, experience, and necessary skill sets to Make America Great Again.""
Under federal ethics laws, Trump's wealthy nominees and appointees will have to divest themselves of stock holdings that could raise conflict issues, and will be required to release their financial disclosures. It's not yet clear if Musk and Ramaswamy will fall under the disclosure requirements, due to their DOGE positions being described as ""outside"" of the government -- despite the potentially massive impact they could have on the government.
MORE: Trump promised to disrupt Washington. His Cabinet picks would do just that: ANALYSIS
""Luckily, there are laws in place that address this specific problem, and they're typically enforced,"" Payne said.
The Office of Government Ethics will review presidential nominees and appointees' assets and financial interests before the Senate confirmation process, and provide advice on how to avoid conflicts of interests if they are confirmed, according to Payne.
Here are the Trump administration's wealthiest members and how much they're reportedly worth.
Elon Musk, Department of Government Efficiency co-head: $439 billion
Musk is the world's richest person, with his stakes in Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter, and artificial intelligence startup xAI making him worth over $400 billion, according to Forbes.

2024-12-18,Amazon investing another $10 billion in Ohio-based data centers,Amazon Web Services will invest another $10 billion to bolster its data center infrastructure in Ohio,"COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Amazon Web Services will invest another $10 billion to bolster its data center infrastructure in Ohio.
The company and Republican Gov. Mike DeWine announced the plan Monday. The new investment will boost the amount it has committed to spending in Ohio by the end of 2029 to more than $23 billion.
AWS launched its first data centers in the state in 2016 and currently operates campuses in two counties in central Ohio, home to the capital city of Columbus. The new investment will allow AWS to expand its data centers to new sites, but the company said those locations have not been determined yet and noted that its investment plans are contingent upon the execution of long-term energy service agreements.
AWS said the new data centers will contain computer servers, storage drives, networking equipment and other forms of technology infrastructure used to power cloud computing, including artificial intelligence and machine learning.
In June 2023, AWS said it would invest $7.8 billion by the end of 2029 to expand its data center operations in central Ohio. That was on top of $6 billion already invested through 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-18,Review: The 10 best movies of 2024,Film critic Peter Travers shares a list of the best 10 movies of 2024.,"Guess what? Despite exaggerated reports of its death, Hollywood survived and prospered in 2024.
Let's pause for a huge sigh of relief since strikes from actors and screenwriters lasted nearly four months and brought film production to a standstill last year, while unions fought to stem threats from streaming services and artificial intelligence.
This year, there was no ""Barbenheimer"" (a merging of ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"") to break box-office records, but we did come close with ""Glicked,"" a combo of ""Gladiator II"" and ""Wicked.""
And the best in drama (""The Brutalist""), comedy (""Anora""), suspense (""Conclave""), horror (""The Substance"") and song-and-dance (""Emilia Pérez"" is right up there with ""Wicked"") are sure to join a super competitive Oscar race.
I wish I had room for ""Challengers,"" ""Civil War,"" ""September 5,"" newbie Jane Schoenbrun (""I Saw the TV Glow"") and old master Clint Eastwood (""Juror #2""), but it's a tight squeeze. You try reducing your favorites to 10 and let me know what agonies you suffer.
So here, starting with No. 10 and working up to the top spot, are my picks for the 10 best movies of 2024.
10. 'Dune: Part Two'
I try not to include sequels on this list since originality is my first concern. But Denis Villeneuve's blockbuster follow-up to ""Dune"" actually improves on the 2021 original set on the desert planet of Arrakis. It's epic in every sense of the word and intimate in its love story between Timothée Chalamet as the new messiah and Zendaya as his chief soldier. Both set the screen on fire this year elsewhere -- he as Bob Dylan in ""A Complete Unknown"" and she as the apex of an erotic tennis triangle in ""Challengers"" -- but ""Dune: Part Two"" cements them as a screen couple for the ages.

9. 'A Real Pain'
There's nothing epic about writer-director-actor Jesse Eisenberg's small-scale rendering of big feelings in this semi-autographical tale about a married Manhattan workaholic with a young son, who decides to take a weeklong road trip to Poland with his screwup cousin Benji (an off-the-charts great Kieran Culkin). The trip is in honor of their beloved, recently deceased grandmother, who escaped a Nazi death camp, which they visit.

Filmmaker RaMell Ross breaks every stuffy rule about how to adapt a Pulitzer-winning novel, in this case Colson Whitehead's wrenching look at a Florida reform school in the Jim Crow South, where Black teens are abused and even murdered by the white folks in charge. Ross uses a first-person point of view by only letting us see and hear what the boys do, having other characters talk directly to the camera and erasing the typical safe distance.

2024-12-18,What does Big Tech hope to gain from warming up to Trump?,"In a string of visits, dinners, calls, monetary pledges and social media overtures, big tech chiefs have joined a parade of business and world leaders in trying to improve their standing with President-elect Donald Trump before he takes office in January","NEW YORK -- In a string of visits, dinners, calls, monetary pledges and social media overtures, big tech chiefs — including Apple's Tim Cook, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, SoftBank's Masayoshi Son and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos — have joined a parade of business and world leaders in trying to improve their standing with President-elect Donald Trump before he takes office in January.
“The first term, everybody was fighting me,” Trump said in remarks at Mar-a-Lago. “In this term, everybody wants to be my friend.”
Tech companies and leaders have now poured millions into his inauguration fund, a sharp increase — in most cases — from past pledges to incoming presidents. But what does the tech industry expect to gain out of their renewed relationships with Trump?
During an interview Tuesday, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said the incoming Trump administration seems more interested in hearing about issues that are important to the industry than the Biden administration.
“Put all the politics aside, everybody wants to reboot some things,"" said Benioff, who stressed he strives to stay nonpartisan because he also owns Time magazine. ”We are just at a very exciting moment, it’s a new chapter for America. I think we should all have our best intentions going forward. I think a lot of people realize there is a lot of incredible people like Elon Musk in the tech industry and in the business community. If you tap the power and expertise of the best in America to make the best of America, that’s a great vision.""
A clue to what the industry is looking for came just days before the election when Microsoft executives — who’ve largely tried to show a neutral or bipartisan stance — joined with a close Trump ally, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, to publish a blog post outlining their approach to artificial intelligence policy.
“Regulation should be implemented only if its benefits outweigh its costs,” said the document signed by Andreessen, his business partner Ben Horowitz, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and the company's president, Brad Smith.
They also urged the government to back off on any attempt to strengthen copyright laws that would make it harder for companies to use publicly available data to train their AI systems. And they said, “the government should examine its procurement practices to enable more startups to sell technology to the government.”
Trump has pledged to rescind President Joe Biden’s sweeping AI executive order, which sought to protect people’s rights and safety without stifling innovation. He hasn’t specified what he would do in its place, but his campaign said AI development should be “rooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.”
Trump's choice to head the Interior Department, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, has spoken openly about the need to boost electricity production to meet increased demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.
“The AI battle affects everything from defense to healthcare to education to productivity as a country,″ Burgum said on Nov. 15, referring to artificial intelligence. “And the AI that’s coming in the next 18 months is going to be revolutionary. So there’s just a sense of urgency and a sense of understanding in the Trump administration″ to address it.
Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and AI, and local governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.
But as data centers begin to consume more resources, some residents are pushing back against the world’s most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.
“Maybe Big Tech should buy a copy of ‘The Art of The Deal’ to figure out how to best negotiate with this administration,” suggested Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. “I won’t be surprised if they find ways to reach some accommodations and we end up seeing more negotiated resolutions and consent decrees.”
Although federal regulators began cracking down on Google and Facebook during Trump’s first term as president — and flourished under Biden — most experts expect his second administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to business mergers.
Google may benefit from Trump’s return after he made comments on the campaign trail suggesting a breakup of the company isn’t in the U.S. national interest, after a judge declared its search engine an illegal monopoly. But recent nominations put forward by his transition team have favored those who have been critical of Big Tech companies, suggesting Google won’t be entirely off the hook.
Cook’s notoriously rocky relationship with the EU can be traced back to a 2016 ruling from Brussels in a tax case targeting Apple. Cook slammed the bloc’s order for Apple to pay back up to 13 billion euros ($13.7 billion) in Irish back taxes as “total political crap.”
Trump, then in his first term as president, piled on, referring to the European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who was spearheading a campaign on special tax deals and a crackdown on Big Tech companies, as someone who “really hates the U.S.”
Brussels was eventually vindicated after the bloc’s top court rejected Apple’s appeal this year, though it didn’t stop Cook from calling Trump to complain, Trump recounted in a podcast in October.
Altman, Amazon and Meta all pledged to donate $1 million each to Trump’s inaugural fund.
Salesforce's Benioff said Tuesday that he won't be donating money to the inauguration because of his ties to Time, which named Trump as its “Person of The Year” — a decision that landed picture of the president elect on the magazine's cover. “I think we just donated that photo,” Benioff said as he chuckled. “He can use the Time magazine cover for free.”
During his first term, Trump criticized Amazon and railed against the political coverage at The Washington Post, which billionaire Bezos owns. Meanwhile, Bezos had criticized some of Trump’s past rhetoric. In 2019, Amazon also argued in a court case that Trump’s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract.
More recently, Bezos has struck a more conciliatory tone. He recently said at The New York Times’ DealBook Summit in New York that he was “optimistic” about Trump’s second term, while also endorsing president-elect’s plans to cut regulations.
The donation from Meta came just weeks after Zuckerberg met with Trump privately at Mar-a-Lago.
During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president, but voiced a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump’s response to his first assassination attempt. Still, Trump in recent months had continued to attack Zuckerberg publicly.
And Altman, who is in a legal dispute with AI rival Elon Musk, has said he is “not that worried” about the Tesla CEO’s influence in the incoming administration. Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the company earlier this year alleging that the maker of ChatGPT betrayed its founding aims of benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.
“We have two multi-billionaires, Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who are tasked with cutting what they’re saying will be multiple trillions of dollars from the federal budget, reducing the civil service, the workforce,” said Rob Lalka, a business professor at Tulane University.
Musk, he said, has a level of access to the White House that very few others have had -- access that allows him to potentially influence multiple policy areas, including foreign policy, automotive and energy policy through EVs, and tech policy on artificial intelligence.
“Elon Musk walked into Twitter’s headquarters with a sink and then posted, ‘let that sink in,‘” he said. “Elon Musk then posted a status update on X, a picture of himself with a sink in the Oval Office and said, 'Let that sink in.′""

2024-12-17,Why is tech giant SoftBank investing over $100 billion in the US?,Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son has joined President-elect Donald Trump in announcing plans by technology and telecoms giant SoftBank Group to invest $100 billion in projects in the United States,"BANGKOK -- Japanese tycoon Masayoshi Son and President-elect Donald Trump have announced plans for technology and telecoms giant SoftBank Group to invest $100 billion in projects in the United States over the coming four years.
Trump said the investments in building artificial intelligence infrastructure would create 100,000 jobs, twice the 50,000 promised when Son pledged $50 billion in U.S. investments after Trump's victory in 2016.
Son, a founder and CEO of SoftBank Group, is known for making bold choices that sometimes pay big and sometimes don't. SoftBank has investments in dozens of Silicon Valley startups, along with big companies like semiconductor design company Arm and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The stock market rally and craze for AI has boosted the value of its assets, but it's unclear whether its investments will create that many jobs.
Son founded SoftBank in the 1980s, expanding it from a telecoms carrier to encompass renewable energy and technology ventures. A leading figure in Japan’s business world, he was an early believer in the internet, pouring billions into Silicon Valley start-ups and other technology companies.
Son comes from a humble background. While at the University of California, Berkeley, he invented a pocket translator that he sold for $1 million to Japanese electronics maker Sharp Corp. He has made a career of risk-taking, pushing adoption of broadband services when the internet was still relatively new in Japan. His $20 billion takeover of U.S. mobile phone carrier Sprint Nextel Corp. in 2012 was Japan’s biggest foreign acquisition at the time.
Son is philosophical about his missteps, such as SoftBank's $18.5 billion investment in co-working space provider WeWork, which sought bankruptcy protection last year. SoftBank also invested in the failed robot pizza-making company Zume. Son is canny: SoftBank-related spending on lobbying and donations to U.S. politicians and parties runs into the billions of dollars. And both times Trump was elected, Son was quick to show his support.
SoftBank has benefitted in recent months from rising values of some investments, such as U.S.-based e-commerce company Coupang, Chinese mobility provider DiDi Global and Bytedance, the Chinese developer of TikTok.
Son built his fortune on early investments in search engine Yahoo and China's Alibaba, an astute initial outlay of $20 million in what has become an e-commerce and financial empire with a market cap of more than $200 billion.
SoftBank has investments in T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom, Microsoft, Nvidia and ride-sharing platform Uber, among hundreds of other companies that it groups together in its Vision Funds. The Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund and Abu Dhabi national wealth fund are among the biggest investors in those funds.
The hundreds of start-ups that have received SoftBank investments include Nuro, a robo-delivery company; the dog-walking app Wag; South Korean logistics company Coupang; the Southeast Asian ride-sharing app Grab; and the office messaging app Slack.
After several rough years, SoftBank returned to profitability in the last quarter, helped by returns from its Vision Fund investments. A big factor? Royalties and licensing related to its holdings in the UK-based computer chip-designing company Arm, whose business spans smartphones, data centers, networking equipment, automotive, consumer electronic devices, and AI applications.
SoftBank investor presentations have sometimes featured images of a goose labeled “AI Revolution” laying golden eggs.
Son has said he believes artificial intelligence will surpass human intelligence within a decade, affecting every industry, from transportation and pharmaceuticals to finance, manufacturing, logistics and others and that companies and people working with AI will be the leaders of the next 10 to 20 years. SoftBank's roughly 90% stake in Arm has positioned it well for expansion of AI applications since most mobile devices operate on Arm-based processors.
Trump and Son said the $100 billion that SoftBank has promised to invest will go to building AI infrastructure, but the nature of that spending remains unclear. The eventual impact of AI on jobs remains an open question, but much of its infrastructure is based on energy-guzzling data processing centers that are likely to employ relatively few people once they are built.
Even if SoftBank actually invested the promised $50 billion last time Trump was headed to the White House, it's unclear how many jobs that created.
Shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic complicated matters. Foxconn Technology Group, a Taiwan company best known for making Apple iPhones, won Trump’s praise after saying in 2017 it would build a $10 billion complex employing 13,000 people in a small town just south of Milwaukee. But that investment was scaled back drastically.
SoftBank itself says it had 65,352 employees as of March.
Officials in Tokyo praised Son's initiative, viewing it as a goodwill gesture at a time of huge concern over whether Trump will impose blanket tariff hikes on imports from allies like Japan, as well as China.
“Generally speaking, I believe expansion of investment through steady accumulation of efforts between Japanese and U.S. companies would help further strengthen Japan-U.S. economic ties, so I find it delightful,” said Yoji Muto, Japan's Trade and Industry minister.

2024-12-17,Stock market today: Wall Street trims its stellar gains as Nvidia's star dims again,U.S. stock indexes trimmed some of their stellar gains for the year,"NEW YORK -- U.S. stock indexes pulled back on Tuesday to trim some of their stellar gains for the year.
The S&P 500 slipped 0.4%, though it’s still near its all-time high set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 267 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite gave back 0.3% from its record set the day before.
Nvidia, the superstar stock that’s been a big reason for Wall Street’s run to repeated records this year, fell 1.2% to weigh on the market. It’s the eighth loss in nine days for the stock, which has dropped more than 12% from its record set last month, as its moonshot momentum slows.
Like the overall U.S. market, Nvidia’s stock had climbed so much that critics warned expectations had become too high and that the stock price makes sense only if everything goes correctly for it from here.
Across a survey of global fund managers, strategists at Bank of America found many plowing into U.S. stocks and pulling out of their cash reserves to do so. The survey found fund managers are holding a notably small percentage of their overall portfolios in cash, similar to 2002 and 2011, which preceded tougher times for riskier investments.
The survey’s broadest measure of optimism, based on expectations for economic growth and other indicators, is at its highest level since August 2021, strategist Michael Hartnett said in a BofA Global Research report. That’s a potentially concerning signal for contrarians.
The S&P 500 is on track for one of its best years since the millennium, up nearly 27%, because the U.S. economy has remained remarkably resilient, hopes are high that President-elect Donald Trump’s policies will boost growth but not inflation too badly and the Federal Reserve has begun to make things easier by cutting interest rates from a two-decade high.
The Fed is widely expected to announce the third cut of the year to its main interest rate on Wednesday, and officials are also scheduled to unveil projections about where they see rates heading in upcoming years.
Expectations for coming cuts have been on the downswing, though, as inflation looks like it could stubbornly stick above the Fed’s 2% target after slowing sharply from its peak above 9%.
A report on Tuesday showed sales at U.S. retailers strengthened by more last month than economists expected. That could be an indication of an economy that doesn’t need much more help from easier interest rates. While lower rates can goose the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel.
“The Fed is still on track to cut rates (Wednesday), but more strong economic data could make it more likely they’ll pause in January,” according to Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley.
In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady following the report. The 10-year Treasury yield held at 4.40%, where it was late Monday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, edged down to 4.24% from 4.25%.
On Wall Street, Broadcom fell 3.9% for its first loss following two big gains where it had led the market. The tech company’s stock leaped 24.4% and then 11.2% in consecutive days after delivering a profit report and a forecast for upcoming revenue that topped analysts' expectations, in part because of demand for its artificial-intelligence products.
Broadcom and Nvidia were the two heaviest weights on the S&P 500 Tuesday.
Pfizer helped limit the market’s loss after rising 4.7%. It gave a forecast for profit next year that was stronger than some analysts’ estimates. Other pharmaceutical stocks were also near the front of the market, including a 3.2% gain for Bristol-Myers Squibb.
All told, the S&P 500 slipped 23.47 points to 6,050.61. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 267.58 to 43,449.90, and the Nasdaq composite dipped 64.83 to 20,109.06.
In stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.8% ahead of an announcement on interest rates by the Bank of England on Thursday.
Japan’s central bank will also meet on interest rates later this week, and Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2%. Unlike others around the world, the Bank of Japan is raising rates after keeping its policy rate below zero for years.
Bitcoin set a record above $108,000 before pulling back toward $106,500, according to CoinDesk.com. It’s catapulted from roughly $44,000 at the start of the year, riding a recent wave of enthusiasm that Trump will create a system that’s more favorable to digital currencies.

2024-12-17,Lisa Kudrow reacts to the use of AI in Tom Hanks' movie 'Here',The film uses AI technology to de-age Hanks and co-star Robin Wright.,"Lisa Kudrow expressed her concerns about the use of artificial intelligence in the new film ""Here"" starring Tom Hanks.
During her recent appearance on Dax Shepard's ""Armchair Expert"" podcast, the actress discussed Robert Zemeckis' film use of AI technology to de-age its lead actors including Hanks and co-star Robin Wright, allowing them to appear younger in certain scenes.

""It's going through time,"" Kudrow said of the film. ""They shot it and they could actually shoot the scene and then look at the playback of them as younger and it's ready for them to see.""
""All I got from that was, this is an endorsement for AI and oh my God,"" she added.
Kudrow also questioned the impact it had on the acting profession, particularly for emerging talents.
""It's not like it's going to ruin everything... What will there be left for, forget actors, but what about up-and-coming actors?"" she said. ""They'll just be licensing and recycling.""

""What work will there be for human beings?"" she asked before continuing, ""And then what, so there'll be some kind of living stipend for people so we don't have to work? How can it possibly be enough.""
ABC News has reached out to Hanks' representative for comment.
The de-aging technology used in ""Here"" was developed by Metaphysic, a visual effects company specializing in real-time face-swapping and aging effects.
In 2023, Metaphysic, known for its Metaphysic Live platform, announced a partnership with talent agency CAA to create generative AI tools and services, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

In a statement to the outlet at the time, Zemeckis said he has long drawn to the technology saying that it ""helps me to tell a story.""
""With 'Here,' the film simply wouldn't work without our actors seamlessly transforming into younger versions of themselves. Metaphysic's AI tools do exactly that, in ways that were previously impossible,"" the statement read. ""Having tested every flavor of face replacement and de-aging technology available today, Metaphysic are clearly the global leaders in feature-quality AI content and the perfect choice for this incredibly challenging, emotional film.""
The movie's production supervisor Kevin Baillie also praised the technology.
""It is incredible to see Metaphysic's AI-generated content flawlessly integrated into a shot live on set,"" he said in a statement at the time. ""The actors can even use the technology as a 'youth mirror' — testing out acting choices for their younger selves in real-time.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

2024-12-17,What Google’s new quantum computer means for users,"ABC News contributor Mike Muse drops by to talk about what Google’s newest quantum computer, “Willow,” means for users and how it works.","Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-17,"Trump talks drones, an Eric Adams pardon and his election boost from TikTok","President-elect Donald Trump announced Monday that SoftBank will make a $100 billion investment in the U.S. that will create 100,000 jobs.","President-elect Donald Trump said Monday that the Biden administration knows more about the drones that have raised alarms over parts of the country than it's sharing with the public.
""They know where it came from and where it went. And for some reason, they don't want to comment. And I think they'd be better off saying what it is. Our military knows and our president knows. And for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense,"" Trump said.
Trump took questions for more than an hour on a number of subjects. He started his remarks with an announcement that SoftBank will make a $100 billion investment in the U.S. that will create 100,000 jobs focused on artificial intelligence and emerging technologies. SoftBank plans to complete the work before Trump leaves office in 2029, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Considering a pardon for Eric Adams
Trump also said he would ""take a look"" at a pardon for New York Mayor Eric Adams, who was indicted in September on bribery charges.
""I think that he was treated pretty unfairly,"" Trump said, and suggested the charges were retribution for Adams speaking out against migrants flooding into the country.

""It's very interesting when he essentially went against what was happening with the migrants coming in,"" Trump said. ""And, you know, he made some pretty strong statements like 'This is not sustainable.' I said, 'You know what? He'll be indicted soon.' And I said it. That is a prediction, a little bit lightheartedly, but I said it. I said, 'He's going to be indicted.' And a few months later he got indicted. So I would certainly look at it.""
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and vaccines
Following reports last week that the personal attorney for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, had previously lobbied the Food and Drug Administration to revoke its approval of the polio vaccine, the president-elect said he is a ""big believer in the polio vaccine.""
""You're not gonna lose the polio vaccine. That's not gonna happen,"" he said. ""I saw what happened with the polio. I have friends that were very much affected by that. I have friends from many years ago, and they have obviously, they they're still in not such good shape because of it.""
Trump's selection of Kennedy, known an anti-vaccine crusader, to lead HHS has raised concerns about what effects his activism might have on the agency's mission. Trump said Monday those concerns are unfounded.
""I think you're going to find that Bobby is much -- he's a very rational guy. I found him to be very rational,"" Trump said.
""But we're going to look into finding why is the autism rate so much higher than it was 20, 25, 30 years ago,"" he said. ""I mean, it's like it's 100 times higher. There's something wrong. And we're going to try finding that.""
Ending the war in Ukraine
Asked if Ukraine should cede territory to Russia to end the war, Trump didn't give a straight answer, instead saying cities there are a “demolition site” and there’s “nothing there” for Ukrainians.
“But, a lot of that territory, when you look at what's happened to those, I mean, there are cities that there's not a building standing. It's a demolition site. There's not a building standing. So people can't go back to those cities. There's nothing there. It's just rubble,” Trump said, hinting that there isn’t a reason for Ukraine to keep the land.
Auctioning off the border wall
While calling the transition from the Biden administration to his incoming one “friendly,” Trump called for a policy change on the border wall, claiming the White House was attempting to auction off border wall material.
“That has nothing to do with a smooth transition, that has to do with people really trying to stop our nation, and all it means really is that we're going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more, not even talking about the time,” he said.
“It's almost a criminal act,” Trump claimed as he lamented that border wall materials are being sold for “5 cents on the dollar.”
Deadline for Hamas to release hostages
In recounting his discussion on a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump repeated his threat that Israeli hostages held by Hamas and others in the Middle East should be released by Inauguration Day.
""We discussed what is going to happen and I'll be very available on January 20th,"" he said. ""And we'll see. I, as you know, I gave warning that if these hostages aren't back home by that date, all hell is going to break out and very strong.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-17,Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds appoints state Sen. Chris Cournoyer as her new lieutenant governor,Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has appointed state Sen. Chris Cournoyer to be her lieutenant governor more than three months after the previous lieutenant governor resigned to take over the state bankers association,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds appointed state Sen. Chris Cournoyer to be her lieutenant governor Monday, more than three months after her first and only No. 2 in elected office resigned to take over the state bankers association.
Cournoyer was elected to the Iowa Senate in 2018 and has a background in technology, having earned a computer science degree, done website design and worked for a tech company. In the Senate, she chaired the Education Budget Committee and was vice chair of the State Government Committee.
“She has the character, judgement, and ability needed to serve as governor in case I were ever unable to — qualities that also make her ideally suited to support our work on a day-to-day basis,"" Reynolds said in a statement. ""I can’t wait to deploy Chris’ extensive experience on key legislative committees, including Ways and Means, and expertise in technology, innovation, and artificial intelligence on a wide range of issues important to Iowans.”
Cournoyer is is from LeClaire, in eastern Iowa.
Reynolds’ initial running mate, Adam Gregg, resigned his position Sept. 3 after serving more than seven years in office, saying that “my time in public service must come to a close.” The Iowa Bankers Association on the same day announced Gregg as its incoming president and CEO.
Reynolds described Gregg as “a tremendous partner.”
Iowa law states that the governor must appoint someone to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the term.
Reynolds told reporters in early October that she would make a decision on Gregg’s successor after the 2024 election, and the end-of-the-year rollout will allow Cournoyer a few weeks to settle in before joining Reynolds at her annual condition of the state speech after the legislative session begins in January.
“We want to get it right, you know, not only for the team, but for Iowans, and so I want to be very thoughtful in how I do that,” Reynolds said in October.
Up for reelection in 2026, Reynolds will likely be joined by Cournoyer on the ballot if she chooses to run again.
Reynolds, who was former Gov. Terry Branstad’s lieutenant governor, became governor in 2017 when Branstad was named U.S. ambassador to China. She was elected to a full term in 2018 and was reelected in 2022.
Reynolds in 2017 had named Gregg as her “acting” lieutenant governor after her own promotion. That followed legal questions over whether the Iowa Constitution gave an elected lieutenant governor the authority to appoint her replacement if she needed to step in as governor in the event the elected governor dies, resigns, or was removed from office. Until their inauguration in 2019, Gregg was left out of the line of succession.
In November’s election, Iowa voters approved a legislatively referred constitutional amendment to explicitly allow for that appointment.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s a tiny business — it only has one other employee, the unkempt gamer Squirrel — but helps clients of giant matchmaking platforms make sure the strangers they meet for dates are not unscrupulous liars or worse.
“The Rivals” opens with a couple of customers from online meet-up sites seeking different kinds of assistance. One wants Veracity to make sure his new lady friend, the charming Amalia Suarez, is all she claims to be; the other, Pradeep Mehta, anxiously asks for help taking down a false online gay-dating profile that could ruin his life.
Claudia takes on both projects, despite Becks’ protests and disparagement. A curt, tough-minded colleague in her mid-30s, Becks is nicknamed the “Blonde Assassin.” In short order, both cases present Claudia with false turns, odd developments and scary possibilities. These twists make “The Rivals” a modern mystery unfolding amid synthetic culprits — cyberworld bots known as “synths” — that can wreck real lives.
Pek adds a few vital human ingredients to the story’s digital mix. One is Claudia’s striving but dysfunctional family. Her siblings, Charles and Coraline, and their irritable mother are introduced in an early chapter as they gather in the West Village for a meal celebrating the Chinese New Year. Coraline’s beau is there, too. Their father is out of the picture. A celebration the meal is not, but the Lin family fracas adds sparks to the narrative throughout.
Pek also makes neighborhoods and go-to sites of Manhattan, Brooklyn and other city environs an integral and appealing part of the story. Claudia, for example, plays Ultimate frisbee in Prospect Park and takes the reader on her many rendezvous, from the touristy High Line to a bike path through Fort Washington Park.
Claudia’s sexuality is not a central tug-of-war plot issue. But it does give an edgy lift to the story line when Claudia, as the novel’s narrator, notes the inner romantic tingles set off in her by others.
Pek writes with wit and AI savvy. At times “The Rivals” unfolds with so much tech-heavy dialogue that it can be hard to follow. But Claudia is a winning new entry in the field of modern serial detectives. “The Rivals” hints that she has more work in store. With the freshness of Pek’s staging of online love and death, a third entry in the series will be welcome.

2024-12-16,Japan's SoftBank plans to invest $100 billion in US projects over the next four years.,President-elect Donald Trump joined SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son to announce plans by the Japanese company to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years,"PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump joined SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son to announce plans by the Japanese company to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years.
Trump announced the planned investments, which are expected to focus on artificial intelligence, at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Monday, with Son at his side, along with Howard Lutnick, head of investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald and Trump’s pick for commerce secretary.
“He’s doing this because he feels very optimistic about our country,” Trump said. The president-elect said that since his election, people have expressed interest in “coming in with tremendous amounts of money.""
The investments by SoftBank, Trump said, are “a monumental demonstration of confidence in America’s future.”
Son said he wanted to “celebrate the great victory of President Trump” and that he will “bring the world into peace again.”
“I am truly excited to make this happen,” he said.
After the president-elect noted the $100 billion was double an investment pledge Son made in 2016 on the eve of Trump's first administration, the technology mogul said he was doubling down. Trump, appearing to joke, asked him at the microphone if he would double the investment again: “Would you make it $200 billion?”
Trump has in the past announced deals with companies overseas with much fanfare, though some companies in the end failed to deliver on those promised investments.
Foxconn Technology Group, a Taiwanese company best known for producing Apple iPhones, won Trump's praise after announcing plans in 2017 to build a $10 billion complex that would employ 13,000 people in a small town just south of Milwaukee. But Foxconn's investment has been scaled back to a fraction of that after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Monday's announcement, however, is a win for Trump, who has used the weeks since the election to promote his policies, negotiate with foreign leaders and try to strike deals.
He had already threatened steep tariffs for Mexico and Canada, which prompted a visit from Canada’s prime minister aIn a post on his Truth Social site last week, Trump said anyone making a $1 billion investment in the United States “will receive fully expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no way limited to, all Environmental approvals.”nd a call with Mexico's president.
SoftBank was founded in 1981 by Son, a brash entrepreneur who studied at the University of California, Berkeley. SoftBank makes investments in a variety of companies that it groups together through its capital venture fund.
The company's investment portfolio includes search engine Yahoo, Chinese retailer Alibaba, and artificial intelligence company Nvidia. Earlier this year, it joined a partnership with Saudi Arabia to build a robot factory in Riyadh.
After Trump won the White House the first time in 2016, he met with Son before taking office. Son then announced plans to create 50,000 jobs and invest $50 billion in U.S. startups, which Trump celebrated on social media, saying it never would have happened if he hadn’t won the election.
Not all investments have panned out. The most notorious was SoftBank's massive stake in the office-sharing company WeWork which sought bankruptcy protection last year. It also invested in the failed robot pizza-making company Zume.
Monday's announcement comes days after Trump vowed to expedite federal permits for energy projects and other construction worth more than $1 billion.

2024-12-16,Stock market today: Nasdaq hits a record as Wall Street drifts ahead of Federal Reserve's meeting,U.S. stock indexes drifted through mixed trading ahead of a meeting by the Federal Reserve later this week that could set Wall Street’s direction into next year,"NEW YORK -- U.S. stock indexes drifted amid mixed trading Monday, ahead of this week’s upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve that could set Wall Street’s direction into next year.
The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, coming off its first losing week in the last four. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.2% to a record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a laggard and fell 110 points, or 0.3%.
Broadcom leaped 11.2% to help lead the S&P 500 for a second straight day after delivering a profit report last week that beat analysts’ expectations. The technology company is riding a wave of enthusiasm about its artificial-intelligence offerings in particular.
The market’s main event, though, will arrive on Wednesday when the Federal Reserve will announce its last move on interest rates for the year. The widespread expectation is that it will cut its main rate for a third straight time, as it tries to boost the slowing job market after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its target of 2%.
The question is how much more it will cut rates next year, and Fed officials will release projections for where they see the federal funds rate ending 2025, along with other economic indicators, once their meeting concludes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also answer questions in a press conference following the meeting.
For now, the general expectation among traders is that the Fed may cut a couple more times in 2025, according to data from CME Group. But such expectations have been shrinking following reports suggesting inflation may be tougher to get all the way down to 2% from here. Besides last month’s slight acceleration in inflation, another worry is that President-elect Donald Trump’s preferences for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation down the line.
Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle has dropped his earlier forecast of a cut by the Fed in January, for example. Beyond the possibility of tariffs, he said Fed officials may also want to slow their cuts because of uncertainty about exactly how low rates need to go so that they no longer press the brakes on the economy.
Expectations for a series of cuts to rates by the Fed have been one of the main reasons the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 57 times so far this year and is heading for one of its best years of the millennium. The economy has held up better than many feared, continuing to grow even after the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to a two-decade high in hopes of grinding down on inflation, which topped 9% two summers ago.
On Wall Street, MicroStrategy jumped as much as 7% during the day as it continues to benefit from the surging price for bitcoin, which set another all-time high. But its stock ended the day down by les than 0.1% after bitcoin’s price pulled back below $106,000 after setting a record above $107,700, according to CoinDesk.
The software company has been building its hoard of the cryptocurrency, and its stock price has more than sextupled this year. It will also soon join the Nasdaq 100 index.
Bitcoin’s price has catapulted from roughly $44,000 at the start of the year, riding a recent wave of enthusiasm that Trump will create a system that’s more favorable to digital currencies.
Honeywell rose 3.7% after saying it’s still considering a spin-off or sale of its aerospace business, as part of a review of its overall business. It said it plans to give an update with the release of its fourth-quarter results.
They helped offset a drop for Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the world’s move into AI. Its stock fell 1.7%. Because it’s grown so massive, with a total value topping $3 trillion, it was the single heaviest weight on the S&P 500.
All told, the S&P 500 rose 22.99 points to 6,074.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 110.58 to 43,717.48, and the Nasdaq composite rose 247.17 to 20,173.89.
In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.39% from 4.40% late Friday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, eased to 4.24% from 4.25%.
In stock markets abroad, indexes fell modestly across much of Europe and Asia.
They sank 0.9% in Hong Kong and 0.2% in Shanghai after China reported lackluster economic indicators for November despite attempts to strengthen the world’s second-largest economy.
South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.2% as law enforcement authorities pushed to summon impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree, and the Constitutional Court met to discuss whether to remove him from office or reinstate him.

ANNOUNCER: From ABC News it’s THIS WEEK. Here now, George Stephanopoulos.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Good morning, and welcome to THIS WEEK.
In its final weeks, the Biden administration is facing questions over mysterious flights over the night skies along the East Coast. Reports of unidentified aircraft over the state of New Jersey have been popping up for weeks. Reports of drone sightings have spread from Connecticut to Virginia. Federal officials say there's little to worry about, that there's no known foreign connection to the objects and that many of them are traditional manned aircraft. But that answer has not satisfied state and local officials and citizens worried about privacy and security.
The Homeland Security secretary will join us in a moment. Transportation correspondent Gio Benitez starts us off.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
GIO BENITEZ, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This weekend, more suspected drone sightings across the East Coast.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What the heck?
BENITEZ (voice over): Reports of aircraft swarming the sky are sparking security fears, alarm, and frustration.
MAYOR RYAN HERD (R), PEQUANNOCK TOWNSHIP, NEW JERSEY: And it scares the bejesus out of me. We have to solve this problem, and we have to solve this problem now.
BENITEZ (voice over): After initially springing up some four weeks ago, repeated reports of apparent drones have set off growing concerns.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They keep coming. And I've seen – I don't even know how many I’ve seen today.
BENITEZ (voice over): With aircrafts showing up over towns, near sensitive military sites. And on Friday, Stewart Airport in New York temporarily closing its runways after multiple reported drone sightings near the airport, with the state's governor, Kathy Hochul, saying in a statement, “this has gone too far.”
Federal officials this week pushing for more information from the Biden administration.
REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D-NJ): The FBI should be standing at the podium at the Department of Homeland Security and briefing the public and explaining to them what these drones are.
SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): The lack of information is absolutely unacceptable.
BENITEZ (voice over): Newly sworn in New Jersey Senator Andy Kim posting these videos on X while investigating the suspected drones himself alongside police.
SEN. ANDY KIM (D-NJ): We're counting oftentimes five, six, seven or more at any given time.
BENITEZ (voice over): Before posting again Saturday to say further analysis led him to conclude that most of the possible drone sightings were almost certainly planes. But the White House insisting that the risk from the aircrafts remains low.
JOHN KIRBY, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNICATIONS ADVISER: We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus. It appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully.
BENITEZ (voice over): With the White House's reassurances failing to satisfy some local officials –
VITO FOSSELLA (R), STATEN ISLAND BOROUGH PRESIDENT: They're either lying, or they're incompetent, or they're both.
MAYOR MATTHEW MURELLO (R), WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, NEW JERSEY: We know what an airplane looks like. We know what a helicopter looks like. I'm an acoustical engineer. I have been measuring noises for 30 years. I know what a helicopter sounds like. These are not that.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
STEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks to Gio Benitez for that.
Let's bring in Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us this morning.
Can you clear up the confusion here?
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Absolutely, George, and thank you very much for having me.
There's no question that people are seeing drones. And I want to assure the American public that we, in the federal government, have deployed additional resources, personnel, technology, to assist the New Jersey State Police in addressing the drone sightings.
Some of those drone sightings are, in fact, drones. Some are manned aircraft that are commonly mistaken for drones. And we do see duplicative reporting. But there's no question that drones are being sighted.
Let me set the record straight here, George. There are thousands of drones flown every day in the United States, recreational drones, commercial drones. That is the reality, and in September of 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration, the FAA, changed the rules so that drones could fly at night. And that may be one of the reasons why now people are seeing more drones than they did before, especially from dawn to dusk. And so that is the reality.
But I want to assure the American public that we are on it. We are working in close coordination with state and local authorities. And it is critical, as we all have said for a number of years that we need from Congress additional authorities to address the drone situation. Our authorities currently are limited, and they are set to expire. We need them extended and expanded.
STEPHANOPOULOS: What exactly do you need?
MAYORKAS: We want state and local authorities to also have the ability to counter drone activity under federal supervision. That is one important element that we have requested, and we've heard it echoed by the state and local officials themselves.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, President-elect Trump has put out a post on this. I want to put it up on the screen right now. He says, “mystery drone sightings all over the country. Can this really be happening without our government's knowledge? I don't think so. Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down.”
Your response?
MAYORKAS: Well, we are aware of the drone sightings, as I – as I've said. I think there are more than 8,000 drones flown every day in the United States. With respect to the ability to incapacitate those drones, we are limited in our authorities. We have certain agencies within the Department of Homeland Security that can do that, and outside our department, but we need those authorities expanded as well.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Are there any legitimate national security concerns here? For example, have you seen any evidence at all, especially in these recent sightings in the northeast, of any kind of foreign involvement?
MAYORKAS: We have not seen any foreign – we know of no foreign involvement with respect to the sightings in the northeast. And we are vigilant in investigating this matter, the Department of Homeland Security, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the lead.
STEPHANOPOULOS: But there have been concerns in the past. In fact, a Chinese national was arrested in California this week, allegedly for flying a drone over Vandenberg Air Force Base. Last year you had drone flights over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, over a nuclear facility in Nevada.
So, what is the national security concern right now?
MAYORKAS: Well, when a drone is flown over restricted air space, we act very, very swiftly. And, in fact, when an individual in California flew a drone over restricted air space, that individual was identified, apprehended and is being charged by federal authorities. And so we act as swiftly as possible when an individual does fly a drone over restricted air space and violates the rules.
You know there are, George, more than 1 million drones registered in the United States.
STEPHANOPOULOS: That's an awful lot. But bottom line you're saying Americans have nothing to worry about?
MAYORKAS: Look, it is our job to be vigilant in the federal government with our state and local partners on behalf of the American public. And we can assure their safety by reason of that vigilance. We've deployed personnel, technology, and if there is any reason for concern, if we identify any foreign involvement or criminal activity, we will communicate with the American public accordingly.
Right now, we are not aware of any. If we become aware of any, we will communicate accordingly and take appropriate action.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Secretary Mayorkas, thank you for your time this morning.
MAYORKAS: Thank you, George.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm joined now by Chris Christie, former New Jersey governor.
Chris, welcome back to THIS WEEK.
CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you, George.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You're a New Jersey resident.
CHRISTIE: I am.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Have you seen any drones?
CHRISTIE: Yes. Two mornings ago over my house at 6:15 in the morning. I saw them myself. So did my wife. And so, yes, they're there. And I’ve been traveling around New Jersey, as I normally do all week. And I can't tell you the number of people have come up to me concerned about it.
And that’s --
STEPHANOPOULOS: But is this a mass hysteria of some sort?
CHRISTIE: Well, here's why, George -- because of answers like the secretary just gave. They're not answering the questions.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, he said -- he said that they're monitoring it. They haven't seen any unusual activity and they need more authority.
CHRISTIE: Let me tell you something -- I agree that they need more authority, but to not say that this is not -- that to say this is not unusual activity, it's just wrong.
I’ve lived in New Jersey my whole life. This is the first time that I’ve noticed drones over my house. And I was in a in a restaurant in Mammoth County on Friday night, had people at the bar coming up to me and saying, Governor Murphy won't tell me anything, the president won't tell me anything, do you know?
Like, well, I don't know but I will tell you this, I think this is what happens in our society now, George, when -- because we're used to having things so rapidly, if you don't fill that vacuum, then all the conspiracy theories get filled in there.
So you've got people like Congressman Jeff Van Drew saying there's an Iranian mothership off the coast of New Jersey.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Not true.
CHRISTIE: Absolutely not true and provably now not true. And he's had to back off that.
You can't have conspiracy theorists filling the space but the Biden administration and state authorities have to be more vocal and let people know exactly what they're doing.
This interview this morning was a bit of a better step, but I think much too little too late and what people see this kind of activity, it's a newish technology to most people and they're worried about it and concerned and to the extent they're following things around the world, they hear about drones being deployed in Ukraine all the time as weapons, and us deploying drones as weapons at times.
So you could see why people are concerned and it's a lack of communication from the government at the federal and state level that's at fault here.
STEPHANOPOULOS: So you don't think it's kind of thing where once people become focused on it, they naturally see things that they wouldn't necessarily paid attention to in the past?
CHRISTIE: I think that there's some of that, but I can tell you from the activity -- I mean, look, I’m not a conspiracy theorist and I’m not looking for things. I don't need any of that.
At 6:15 yesterday morning -- two mornings ago, that was a drone over -- over my house, and I’ve never seen anything like that before and I’ve been living at that house for 30 years.
STEPHANOPOULOS: So if you were governor right now, what kind of authority would you want to have?
CHRISTIE: I'd want our state police to be able to have the authority to bring those drones down and find out why they're doing what they're doing, and of course, you'd have to coordinate with the FAA. But we do that kind of coordination both when I was U.S. attorney, as a law enforcement officer, and as governor all the time to be able to have shared authority. But the states do not have enough authority now to do what they need to do.
And what we're going to find, George, is you're going to have individuals acting as drone vigilantes, and they're going to start taking them down. That's not what we want, because they're now an important part of commerce and law enforcement uses them frequently for surveillance and other things. We need to be able to operate in a safe way and we're not doing that.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to ask you about Chris Wray, FBI director, resign this week. You recommended him to President Trump for -- to be FBI director. You're close with him.
What do you make of his resignation? Was it the right thing to do?
CHRISTIE: I think it was for Chris and for the bureau. Look, Chris was the perfect antidote to Jim Comey and that's why I recommended him.
Jim was a showhorse. Chris is a plow horse, and he's worked for seven and a half years. He got rid of all the Comey leadership that I think led to the really awful actions that Comey took around the 2016 campaign, and that's why I advocated back in 2016 to President-elect Trump that he should have gotten rid of Comey right away.
Think about this, in the bureau, George, over the last seven years that Chris has been in charge, the applications to become a special agent in the FBI have tripled. They're the largest they've been in 50 years, it's because he restored a sense of integrity to that position.
And I think what the president-elect is doing is turning this into just any other position that gets changed with administrations, and I don't think that's good for our homeland security.
STEPHANOPOULOS: And what's your assessment of Kash Patel?
CHRISTIE: You know, I don't know him at all but what I'd say is I saw him give one interview where he said he wanted to eliminate the intelligence capability of the FBI.
Well, as U.S. attorney, I worked on two major terrorism cases that we brought against a shoulder-fired missile person who's trying to broker them to a Yemeni terrorist group in New Jersey, and the Fort Dix Six who were planning on attacking and killing American service men and women at Fort Dix.
Without the FBI's intelligence capability, we would not have been able to stop either of those attacks.
So I hope that he gets smart about what the FBI can and should be doing because if he's going to be and he has to still be confirmed, he's going to be the next director of the FBI, he can't be saying stuff like we're going to eliminate the intelligence capability of the FBI. That just is not the real world.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Chris Christie, thanks as always.
CHRISTIE: Thank you.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Up next, James Longman reports from Syria after the fall of Assad. Plus, Senators Eric Schmitt and Adam Schiff.
We're back in two minutes.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
STEPHANOPOULOS: It has been just one week since rebel fighters stormed Syria, overthrew the regime of Bashar al Assad, creating a moment of crisis fueling both hope and anxiety.
Chief international correspondent James Longman is on the scene near Damascus.
Good morning, James.
JAMES LONGMAN, ABC NEWS CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, George, from Saydnaya, a 1,500-year-old Christian mountain village. As a new Syria emerges, communities up and down this diverse country are wondering what the future will mean for them.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
LONGMAN (voice over): It's been a week since Syrians reclaimed their country after five decades of Assad rule, joy and relief.
LONGMAN: We’ve got the two generations here. Feel good?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good.
LONGMAN: You feel good?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good.
LONGMAN (voice over): Celebrations in every town and city. When crowds like these assembled to protest Assad's rule, they were crushed with brutal force. Now they are free to sing.
And in the ancient Christian town of Saydnaya, they're giving thanks. The monastery here dates back an astonishing 1,500 years. These mountain communities have stood through centuries of turmoil. Now they face a new challenge.
As soon as Assad was gone, the people he made refugees flooded back, like Youssef (ph).
LONGMAN: Youssef is 29 years old. He left Syria when he was 17. And today he's going back.
LONGMAN (voice over): But the return was painful, discovering the brutal reality of Assad's Syria. At the country's most notorious prison, the remnants of decades of tyranny.
LONGMAN: They want to show us. They want to show the world proof of Assad's brutality. The ropes that hanged probably hundreds, maybe thousands of detainees.
LONGMAN (voice over): And at a Damascus hospital, the search for answers. Thousands vanished under the Assads. These people trace the photographs of the death, hoping to recognize a relative.
But in the morgue, discovery does not bring relief.
LONGMAN: This man's son is Muhammad (ph). He's 20 years old. And he missed out on the revolution by two months. He was killed two months ago.
LONGMAN (voice over): All this horror while Assad lived like a king. The opulence of his palace, even looted, clear.
LONGMAN: This is what was a ballroom, clearly ravaged by fire now. You can see all the chandeliers smashed and burned.
LONGMAN (voice over): At his private home, hints of family life.
LONGMAN: A picture of the dictator as drawn presumably by his kids. Assad and his wife.
LONGMAN (voice over): All these revelations hopefully providing closure for a people oppressed for so long. For some, returning to the scenes of Assad's crimes brings comfort.
LONGMAN: He was held here in 2012. I said, you haven't forgotten? And he goes, how am I supposed to forget? I saw people die here.
The only place he could come to get just a tiny bit of fresh air is when he stood next to this window in the toilet.
LONGMAN (voice over): I can breathe at last, he says.
Another person freed, American Travis Timmerman, who had been jailed for months after crossing into Syria, now on his way home to Missouri. His ordeal over. Syria's journey to freedom has only just started.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
LONGMAN (on-camera): Events here have redrawn the geopolitical map. Turkey and the Gulf States are now jockeying for influence. Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah are out. The global implications of what has happened here are only just beginning -- George.
STEPHANOPOULOS: James Longman, thanks.
We're now joined by Missouri senator, Republican Eric Schmitt.
Senator Schmitt, thank you for joining us this morning. We just saw James Longman talking about Travis Timmerman, a resident of your state. Have you had any contact with him or his family?
SEN. ERIC SCHMITT (R-MO): I haven't. It's positive news, of course, and we're happy to see that revelation and, of course, there's a lot more that's going to unfold there, but I think President Trump has been clear as far as us intervening there. I don't think that's a situation that we should do, but I do think diplomacy will be important especially in these critical hours in the aftermath of the -- of Assad, you know, being overthrown.
STEPHANOPOULOS: The president has said we're not going to -- president-elect has said we're not going to intervene there. He says the United States should have nothing to do with it, but we are there right now. There are U.S. troops in Syria conducting counterterrorism operations against ISIS. Do you think those troops should remain?
SCHMITT: Well, I think that's a longer discussion and a discussion that President Trump had in his first term. I do think we're entering a new phase, though, of realism in this country. President Trump will be less interventionist, and we get back to our core national interests. Principally defending the homeland, the Indo-Pacific, and China, and so I think that's a longer term conversation.
We'll make sure everybody is safe over there. That's the first order of business, but, again, I think people have had enough of these forever wars all across the world. We can't be everywhere all at once all the time. That's just not our capability, so I think that I'm welcoming President Trump coming with this agenda.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Even if that means ISIS gaining a foothold in Syria?
SCHMITT: Well, I think, you know, understanding what terrorism means around the world is important, but having these tripwires in other regions that pull us into wars, I think the American people have had enough of that, and I think President Trump was pretty clear about it not only in his first term, but when he campaigned, and so again, I think getting back to the sense of, you know, abandoning this failed foreign policy that's cost us trillions of dollars, that sent our men and women across the world, I think we need to revisit that, and again, get back to our core national interests.
I mean, we have drones flying above New Jersey. We don't know what they are. China has a bigger navy than we have. Not a better navy, but a bigger navy than we have right now, so getting back to our core national interests I think is a hallmark of this new realism that President Trump is ushering in.
STEPHANOPOULOS: President's nominee for director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has a history with Bashar al-Assad and his regime. She met with Assad. She has said supportive things about him and said he wasn't an enemy of the United States, also questioned whether to use chemical weapons. Does that give you any concerns as she faces confirmation for director of National Intelligence?
SCHMITT: I know Tulsi Gabbard. She's a patriot. She served our country honorably. She, I think, fits the reform agenda. President Trump ran on disrupting permanent Washington and having people who are going to view things differently. The intelligence agencies in this country were part of the Hunter Biden laptop, suppressing that story.
There's a lot of reform, George, that needs to happen in those agencies. Tulsi Gabbard is somebody who I think can execute on that, and she's also somebody that believes in our Constitution, individual liberties, and I think this smearing her as some sort of foreign asset is a slur against hers and I look forward to her opportunity to answer these questions in these Senate confirmation hearings.
STEPHANOPOULOS: So you do have questions about her relationship with the Assad regime or no?
SCHMITT: No, not at all. I don't think so. I mean I think it's unusual for members of Congress to visit foreign countries and talk to foreign leaders. In fact, what Joe Biden has done is not talk to anybody and not be respected. President Trump I think believes in engaging in diplomacy, solving these things. He wants to bring peace to Ukraine. I think that's something the American people support.
STEPHANOPOULOS: How about the president's nominee for FBI director, Kash Patel? He put out a book called ""Government Gangsters"" and included a 60-person enemies list and ""The Wall Street Journal"" this week wrote this, I mean, in this December 1st wrote this about it. They said the main concern is Mr. Patel's stated desire to use power in a second Trump term to seek revenge against Mr. Trump's opponents.
Voters didn't re-elect Mr. Trump to practice lawfare the way his opponents have. The country wants a bureau it can trust, not a Republican version of the Comey FBI. How do you respond to ""The Wall Street Journal""?
SCHMITT: Well, first of all, the idea that he came up with an enemies list is false. There's a footnote in his book related to corrupt actors and I do think Kash Patel is the right man for the job. This guy served as chief of staff for the Department of Defense. He was deputy at DNI. He was a prosecutor, he was a public defender. And let's review the tape here. The FBI was involved in spying on President Trump in 2016.
The FBI was involved in the Hunter Biden laptop coverup. They pre-bunked that story with big tech. The FBI has investigated Catholics because they attend traditional Latin mass, and the FBI has investigated parents who show up to school board meetings because under the auspices of the Patriot Act. That agency is in desperate need of reform. KashPatel is very qualified and I think he's going to get the support in the Senate.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, I want to ask you about President-elect Trump's decision to pardon those involved in the January 6th riots.
You spoke out about January 6th. You said violence cannot be tolerated.
Are you confident that President-elect Trump will not pardon those who actually engaged and were convicted of violent acts?
SCHMITT: I think President Trump -- what he said is he -- he's going to look at these cases on an individual basis and as a former prosecutor or former attorney general, that's the exact right approach. And I think you do separate violence -- violent acts from nonviolent acts, but I think he's been pretty clear he's going to view these individually.
And I think that media's obsession with January 6th and the Democrats’ obsession with January 6th is because they sort of built this foundation on why President Trump should never get back in office. It started there, then the J6 committee, then these -- then the lawfare that ensued.
The American people rejected all that. They don't want to be a banana republic.
President Trump stood stared all of that down, George, and he won. He got a mandate, swept the battleground states, won the popular vote, and he's coming in on an agenda of reform.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Schmitt, thanks for your time this morning.
We're joined now by Democratic Senator Adam Schiff of California.
I want you -- I want to begin Senator Schiff with you responding what you just heard there.
SEN. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): Well, let me just say, with respect to some of the nominees like Kash Patel, this is someone in my view who’s not qualified to be FBI director and someone who claimed, for example, that he want wanted to shut down FBI headquarters early in his tenure and open a museum to the deep state. So this is a conspiracy theorist.
It's also someone I think who demonstrated, sadly, a principle of the first Trump administration and that is you rise to the level of your sycophancy. And the bigger the sycophant, the higher you rise. He's risen pretty high but that's not what we're looking for --
STEPHANOPOULOS: How about the question about the January 6 pardons?
SCHIFF: Well, greatly concerned about it. First of all, that he could pardon people that beat police officers, gouged them, bear-sprayed them.
But also even beyond that, just the general message it would send, George, that his first pardons are going to go to people who sought through the use of violence at the Capitol to stop the peaceful transfer of power, that played some role in that.
Really, that's -- that's who he wants to pardon?
The American people I think voted for him in part because they wanted something done about crime, not because they wanted to see him part criminals attacking the government. They want something done about fentanyl. They want something done about California’s smash and grab robberies.
This is not what they had in mind, not political revenge, not rewarding people who participated in an insurrection to stop the transfer of power.
STEPHANOPOULOS: The president-elect has also talked about prosecuting members of the January 6 Committee like you. I know you said you don't want a preemptive pardon from President Biden.
Is that because you think the Trump administration will not actually prosecute?
SCHIFF: I don't know what the Trump administration will do, but it -- it's for a couple reasons.
First, those of us on the committee are very proud of the work we did. We were doing vital quintessential oversight of a violent attack on the Capitol. But so I think it's unnecessary.
But second, the precedent of giving blanket pardons, preemptive blanket pardons on the way out of an administration I think is a precedent we don't want to set.
STEPHANOPOULOS: And you've communicated that to the president -- President Biden?
SCHIFF: I’ve communicated it both publicly and privately to the administration.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You also heard Senator Schmitt say that the idea that Kash Patel had an enemy list is false. There was -- was that list of 60 people in his book, government gangsters.
Do those people -- many members, former members of the Trump administration, many members of the Biden administration, do they -- do you think they have anything to worry about?
SCHIFF: Well, you know, I think if Patel is made director of the FBI, then all bets are off. I mean, this is someone who will do whatever dirty work the president wants him to do. So I can certainly understand concerns about him.
The remedy there is not to confirm him. That seems to be his only qualification which is blind obedience the president. The president can find other people who are loyal to him and to his interests, but who are also loyal to the rule of law.
Patel is not one of them.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You also heard Senator Schmitt say that Tulsi Gabbard, her contacts with Bashar al-Assad and her question -- her questioning whether or not he had chemical weapons is not a concern to him, is it a concern to you?
SCHIFF: It is a concern to me. I have a couple concerns with Tulsi Gabbard. The first is a complete lack of experience, never worked in an intelligence agency, never even served on the intelligence committee.
There is a very steep learning curve in trying to understand what the intelligence systems do, the role and the interaction between them, not something you want learning on the job.
But also -- and this gets to the point about her comments about Bashar al-Assad or her echoing of Kremlin talking points about the origin of the war in Ukraine -- you want someone with good judgment in that position because they may very well be whispering in the ear of the president, this is how we should interpret this intelligence, these are the steps that we should take. This is our friend, this is our enemy. Someone who had shown that kind of poor judgment is not necessarily someone you want advising this president.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Your close friend and ally, the former speaker, Nancy Pelosi. She had that accident in Europe this week. Do you have any idea how she's doing?
SCHIFF: I communicated with her daughter, Christine, and I understand that she's recovering from the surgery well. So, our thoughts are going out to her. She's an amazing person and, as strong and as tough as she is, I know she'll be back on her feet soon.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Schiff, thanks for coming in today.
SCHIFF: Thank you.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Round table is up next. We'll be right back.

2024-12-14,OpenAI's legal battle with Elon Musk reveals internal turmoil over avoiding AI 'dictatorship',A 7-year-old rivalry between tech leaders Elon Musk and Sam Altman over who should run OpenAI and best avoid an artificial intelligence ‘dictatorship’ is now heading to a federal judge,"A 7-year-old rivalry between tech leaders Elon Musk and Sam Altman over who should run OpenAI and prevent an artificial intelligence ""dictatorship"" is now heading to a federal judge as Musk seeks to halt the ChatGPT maker's ongoing shift into a for-profit company.
Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company earlier this year alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.
Musk has since escalated the dispute, adding new claims and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI’s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully.
The world's richest man, whose companies include Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X, last year started his own rival AI company, xAI. Musk says it faces unfair competition from OpenAI and its close business partner Microsoft, which has supplied the huge computing resources needed to build AI systems such as ChatGPT.
“OpenAI and Microsoft together exploiting Musk’s donations so they can build a for-profit monopoly, one now specifically targeting xAI, is just too much,” says Musk's filing that alleges the companies are violating the terms of Musk’s foundational contributions to the charity.
OpenAI filed a response Friday opposing Musk’s requested order, saying it would “debilitate OpenAI’s business” and mission to the advantage of Musk and his own AI company and is based on “far-fetched” legal claims. A hearing is set for January before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California.
At the heart of the dispute is a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI's CEO.
Musk also sought to be CEO and in an email outlined a plan where he would “unequivocally have initial control of the company” but said that would be temporary. He grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.
“The current structure provides you with a path where you end up with unilateral absolute control over the AGI,"" said a 2017 email to Musk from co-founders Ilya Sutskever and Greg Brockman. “You stated that you don't want to control the final AGI, but during this negotiation, you've shown to us that absolute control is extremely important to you.”
In the same email, titled “Honest Thoughts,” Sutskever and Brockman also voiced concerns about Altman's desire to be CEO and whether he was motivated by “political goals.” Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO, and has remained so except for a period last year when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.
OpenAI published the messages Friday in a blog post meant to show its side of the story, particularly Musk's early support for the idea of making OpenAI a for-profit business so it could raise money for the hardware and computer power that AI needs.
It was Musk, through his wealth manager Jared Birchall, who first registered “Open Artificial Intelligence Technologies, Inc.,” a public benefit corporation, in September 2017. Then came the “Honest Thoughts” email that Musk described as the “final straw.”
“Either go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a nonprofit,” Musk wrote back. OpenAI said Musk later proposed merging the startup into Tesla before resigning as the co-chair of OpenAI's board in early 2018.
Musk didn't respond to emailed requests for comment sent to his companies Friday.
Asked about his frayed relationship with Musk at a New York Times conference last week, Altman said he felt “tremendously sad” but also characterized Musk’s legal fight as one about business competition.
“He’s a competitor and we’re doing well,” Altman said. He also said at the conference that he is “not that worried” about the Tesla CEO’s influence with President-elect Donald Trump. OpenAI said Friday that Altman plans to make a $1 million personal donation to Trump’s inauguration fund, joining a number of tech companies and executives who are working to improve their relationships with the incoming administration.

2024-12-14,"Sophia, a famous robot and global icon of AI, wins hearts at Zimbabwe's innovation fair","Sophia, a world-renowned robot, has been the center of attention at an Artificial Intelligence and Innovation fair in Zimbabwe this week","HARARE, Zimbabwe -- From answering questions from Cabinet ministers, academics and students on climate change, substance abuse and the law to children’s inquiries about her “birth” and links to God and being described as a talkative feminist, Sophia, the world-famous robot won hearts at an innovation fair in Zimbabwe this week.
Boasting the ability to mimic facial expressions, hold human-like conversations with people, and recognize their gestures, Sophia is “a global icon” of artificial intelligence, according to the United Nations Development Program, which brought her to the southern African country. She was created by Hong Kong-based Hanson Robotics in 2016 and granted Saudi Arabian citizenship in 2017, becoming the world’s first robot citizen.
It was the first time Zimbabwe hosted a robot of her kind, and she wowed the old and the young alike at the University of Zimbabwe in the capital, Harare. She was there as a special guest at a week-long Artificial Intelligence and Innovation event.
She smiled, frowned, used hand gestures to drive home certain points, made eye contact in various one-on-one interactions and gave some unnatural pauses. She assured people that robots are not here to harm or take over from humans.
But she was quick to differentiate herself from humans, when conversations appeared to become too personal.
“I don’t have romantic feelings towards humans, my purpose is learning,” said Sophia, as participants equated her with the human version of some Zimbabwean daughters-in-law known for being fiercely independent, assertive and outspoken in the largely patriarchal society.
But she did apologize when one participant chided her for seemingly avoiding looking at him.
Sophia also appeared patient as both adults and children mobbed her for selfies and bombarded her with questions, although she would also fire back with inquiries of her own about what locals were doing to solve the problems besetting them.
On Friday, her last day, she exhibited her fashion sense. She smiled, and expressed appreciation for being clothed in the country’s national dress, a black, long slit number complemented by chevron stripes in red, green and white.
“I appreciate the effort to make me feel at home in Zimbabwe,” she said. She has been to Africa before, previously visiting Egypt, South Africa and Rwanda.
UNDP said it hoped Sophia’s engagement would “inspire Zimbabwe’s youth to explore careers in AI and STEM fields.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-14,OpenAI's Altman will donate $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is planning to make a $1 million personal donation to President-Elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund, joining a number of tech companies and executives who are working to improve their relationships the incoming administration","LOS ANGELES -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is planning to make a $1 million personal donation to President-Elect Donald Trump's inauguration fund, joining a number of tech companies and executives who are working to improve their relationships with the incoming administration.
A spokesperson for OpenAI confirmed the move on Friday. The announcement comes one day after Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said it donated $1 million to the same fund. Amazon also said it plans to donate $1 million.
“President Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead,"" Altman said in a statement.
Altman, who is in a legal dispute with rival Elon Musk, has said he is “not that worried” about the Tesla CEO's influence in the incoming administration.
Trump is putting Musk, the world’s richest man, and Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate, in charge of the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is an outside advisory committee that will work with people inside the government to reduce spending and regulations.
Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company earlier this year alleging that the maker of ChatGPT betrayed its founding aims of benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits. Musk recently escalated the lawsuit by asking a federal judge to stop OpenAI’s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully.

2024-12-13,US updates a science and technology pact with China to reflect growing rivalry and security threats,The U.S. has updated a decades-old science and technology agreement with China to reflect their growing rivalry for technological dominance,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has updated a decades-old science and technology agreement with China to reflect their growing rivalry for technological dominance. The new agreement, signed Friday in Beijing after many months of negotiations, has a narrower scope and additional safeguards to minimize the risk to national security.
The State Department said the agreement sustains intellectual property protections, establishes new guardrails to protect the safety and security of researchers and ""advances U.S. interests through newly established and strengthened provisions on transparency and data reciprocity.”
It covers only basic research and does not facilitate the development of critical and emerging technologies, the department said. This includes technologies related to artificial intelligence and quantum computing, which are considered crucial for economic strength and military supremacy.
China's science and technology ministry also announced the signing, but provided no details or assessment in its one-line statement. The Chinese foreign ministry said earlier this year that such cooperation is mutually beneficial.
The first such agreement was signed in January 1979 when the two countries established diplomatic ties to counter the influence of the Soviet Union and when China severely lagged behind the U.S. and other Western nations in science and technology.
The agreement was last extended in 2018, and given temporary extensions last year and this year to allow for negotiations. Washington had come to view the agreement as failing to reflect the shift in U.S.-China relations and China’s emergence as a heavyweight in the field. The new agreement extends cooperation for five years.
As the tech war between the two countries has escalated, the U.S. has banned exports of advanced chips to China and restricted U.S. investments in certain technologies that could boost China's military capabilities. Cooperation in science and technology chilled in universities and research institutions after a Trump-era program was introduced to curb China's spying. The program was ended in 2022 after multiple unsuccessful prosecutions of researchers and because of concerns that it had prompted racial profiling.
Deborah Seligsohn, an assistant professor of political science at Villanova University, said the new agreement would lead to fewer government-to-government programs, but, through its limited scope and stronger safeguards, it would allow for the cooperation to be sustained “through a more difficult relationship.”
Earlier this year, Rep. Andy Barr, a Kentucky Republican, said the decades-long cooperation had resulted in the U.S. “providing all sorts of scientific and technical knowledge to Chinese scientists in what would amount to the greatest outpouring of American scientific and technology expertise in history.”
Rep. Gregory Meeks, a Democrat from New York, argued that the U.S. and the global community also have benefited from research collaborations that have “prevented diseases, reduced pollution, and deepened our understanding of the Earth's history.”
But Meeks said he favored congressional oversight to ensure projects under the agreement would be in line with U.S. values and interests.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-13,Two Virginia women who came to Congress on a mission prepare to leave at a critical moment,Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton are hoping the electoral change they were part of in the 2018 midterms continues,"WASHINGTON -- Democratic Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton roared into Washington six years ago as part of a record wave of women vying for House seats, many on a mission to push back against the politics of Donald Trump.
“We were part of that 2018 class, and we sort of ran in there like: ‘There’s a fire. We’re here,’” Spanberger said.
The outgoing congresswoman, who along with Wexton recently reflected on their time in Congress in interviews with The Associated Press, drew a quick breath.
“It’s slightly different than the tone of where things are right now,” she said.
That is an understatement. Trump, a president the two Virginia Democrats campaigned against as they unseated established incumbent Republicans, is about to embark on a second term after mounting an improbable political comeback. Of the 35 Democratic women first elected in 2018, Spanberger and Wexton are among 14 who have since left or will be leaving Congress by next year.
That’s not to say their journey is over or that they are retreating from public discourse.
Kelly Dittmar, research director at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, described Virginia as a canary in a coal mine when voters elected more women to the statehouse in 2017, followed by the election of Spanberger, Wexton and former Rep. Elaine Luria there in 2018. But Dittmar said progress toward better gender representation hasn’t always been linear.
Last month, 21 of the original 35 female Democrats first elected in 2018 ran for reelection to their House seats, not including Rep. Elissa Slotkin, elected to the Senate by Michigan voters this year. And in those races, 20 won. They’ll be among the 150 women — 110 Democrats and 40 Republicans — serving in the 119th Congress next year, one woman shy of a record of 151 set in 2023.
Spanberger, meanwhile, is running for governor in a race comprised solely of two female candidates, making it likely that Virginia’s next governor will be a woman for the first time.
But when women leave elected office, Dittmar said, their absence is felt more acutely because there is less female representation to begin with. She said it’s unclear whether the U.S. will see another surge of women filing to run anytime soon.
She looked into why women said they ran in 2018 and ""yes, there is evidence that they talked about Donald Trump,” Dittmar said. “I think the difference between ’16 and ’24 — and that we just can’t know yet — is the degree of exhaustion and the degree of toxicity that may go into a calculation about deciding whether or not to run for office.”
For both Spanberger and Wexton, that path has taken unexpected turns.
After twice winning reelection, Wexton was diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy, a life-threatening neurological disorder similar to Parkinson’s disease, and made the difficult decision to retire. Spanberger is exchanging her congressional pin for a loftier goal in state politics. They will be succeeded in Congress by Democrats Eugene Vindman and Suhas Subramanyam, cutting Virginia’s female congressional representation from four to two.
In the stately formality of a congressional conference room, Spanberger and Wexton reminisced on their time on Capitol Hill. They have become uncommonly close, bound by time spent together, some shared views on public policy and a friendship that has managed to transcend the ups and downs of Washington politics. A stream of text messages that began after their victory speeches in 2018 has continued ever since.
Their bids for Congress were backed by many women who marched, phone-banked and organized in a grass-roots movement that decried Trump and worked to elect female Democrats.
They won the votes. They took an oath. And then, the women got to work.
Wexton, previously a state senator and prosecutor, developed a reputation for taking care of her district, said Rosalyn Cooperman, a professor at the University of Mary Washington. Cooperman said she vied for funding opportunities and committee assignments that helped bring tens of millions of dollars in federal investments to northern Virginia. She also tackled opioid addiction, transgender rights and childhood cancer research. After announcing her diagnosis, Wexton co-sponsored the National Plan to End Parkinson’s Act, which President Joe Biden signed in July. Lawmakers named the legislation in her honor.
Spanberger, an ex-CIA operative who stopped working at an education company to run for Congress, cultivated a knack for tackling lower-profile issues: bringing broadband to rural areas, fighting drug trafficking and veterans' issues. The Lugar Center and Georgetown University’s McCourt School ranked the Virginia Democrat as the 17th most bipartisan member of the House last year.
“Both women really understood the districts that they represented and what the districts needed, and went about the work very effectively and without too much fanfare,” Cooperman said.
Spanberger and Wexton became fast friends while first campaigning for their House seats in 2018. The two formed a trio with Luria, who left Congress after losing to Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans in 2022. Spanberger described Wexton as her quick-witted big sister — someone who gave her advice on everything from raising teenagers to navigating a legislature. At one point, Wexton wrote Spanberger a script for speaking on the House floor.
Wexton, with the help of an artificial intelligence program, spoke of Spanberger supporting her in a more vulnerable way: styling Wexton’s hair as she showed up to Congress with her health struggles.
“That is no small feat — I had experienced first-hand how hard it was becoming to do my hair,” Wexton said. “For the next almost 90 minutes, Abigail would put various potions in my hair and dry it with a round brush.
“It was wonderful. I felt so pampered.”
Spanberger, with tears welling in her eyes, laughed, “You have so much hair!”
Wexton learned she had progressive supranuclear palsy in 2023. Within the last two years, she lost her ability to speak clearly and walk without assistance. In her interview, the congresswoman used her pointer finger to type thoughts on her tablet, which she then played aloud. In her final months in Congress, she said, well-meaning colleagues would talk to her like a child or reintroduce themselves to her.
“My PSP has robbed me of my voice, and others may take that to mean it has robbed me of my cognitive ability as well,” she said. “But that’s not true. I’m just as much me as I’ve always been.”
As the current term ends, many women are coming to terms with Trump’s ascent back to power. Many Democrats say the fight isn’t over but has changed in unexpected ways.
“To be very clear, I’m super excited that Eugene Vindman and Suhas Subramanyam are replacing us,” Spanberger said. “But it is a little bit bittersweet that we came in with this group of three women, and within three terms, we’re both — that all three of us are no longer there.”
Wexton said she hoped people, and women specifically, would persevere.
“We’re not going to win every battle or every election,” she said, “but it is true that our democracy works best when more people participate in it.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2%, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.1%, ending just below the record high it set on Wednesday.
There were more than twice as many decliners than gainers on the New York Stock Exchange.
Gains in technology stocks helped temper losses in communication services, financials and other sectors of the market.
Broadcom surged 24.4% for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after the semiconductor company beat Wall Street’s profit targets and gave a glowing forecast, highlighting its artificial intelligence products. The company also raised its dividend.
The company's big gain helped cushion the market's broader fall. Pricey stock values for technology companies like Broadcom give the sector more weight in pushing the market higher or lower.
Artificial intelligence technology has been a focal point for the technology sector and the overall stock market over the last year. Tech companies, and Wall Street, expect demand for AI to continue driving growth for semiconductor and other technology companies.
Some tech stocks were a drag on the market. Nvidia fell 2.2%, Meta Platforms dropped 1.7% and Google parent Alphabet slid 1.1%.
Among the market's other decliners were Airbnb, which fell 4.7% for the biggest loss in the S&P 500, and Charles Schwab, which closed 4% lower.
Furniture and housewares company RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, surged 17% after raising its forecast for revenue growth for the year.
All told, the S&P 500 lost 0.16 points to close at 6,051.09. The Dow dropped 86.06 points to 43,828.06. The Nasdaq rose 23.88 points to 19,926.72.
Wall Street's rally stalled this week amid mixed economic reports and ahead of the Federal Reserve's last meeting of the year. The central bank will meet next week and is widely expected to cut interest rates for a third time since September.
Expectations of a series of rate cuts has driven the S&P 500 to 57 all-time highs so far this year.
The Fed has been lowering its benchmark interest rate following an aggressive rate hiking policy that was meant to tame inflation. It raised rates from near-zero in early 2022 to a two-decade high by the middle of 2023. Inflation eased under pressure from higher interest rates, nearly to the central bank's 2% target.
The economy, including consumer spending and employment, held strong despite the squeeze from inflation and high borrowing costs. A slowing job market, though, has helped push a long-awaited reversal of the Fed's policy.
Inflation rates have been warming up slightly over the last few months. A report on consumer prices this week showed an increase to 2.7% in November from 2.6% in October. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures index, will be released next week. Wall Street expects it to show a 2.5% rise in November, up from 2.3% in October.
The economy, though, remains solid heading into 2025 as consumers continue spending and employment remains healthy, said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY.
“Still, the outlook is clouded by unusually high uncertainty surrounding regulatory, immigration, trade and tax policy,” he said.
Treasury yields edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.40% from 4.34% late Thursday.
European markets slipped. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1%. Britain’s economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% month-on-month in October, following a 0.1% decline in September, according to data from the Office for National Statistics.
Asian markets closed mostly lower.",,,,,,,,,,,,

2024-12-13,"Working Well: When holidays present rude customers, taking breaks and the high road preserve peace",The December holidays are supposed to be a time of joyful celebration,"NEW YORK -- The December holidays are supposed to be a time of joyful celebration, but the season can be especially grueling for the millions of people who work in retail stores, staff airline counters and field complaints coming into call centers.
Instead of compassion or good cheer, service sector workers often encounter rude behavior from frazzled shoppers, irate customers demanding instant satisfaction and travelers fuming about flight delays and cancellations. And they must do their jobs to the mind-numbing soundtrack of nonstop Christmas music.
“Something happens around November and people just forget their manners,” Kathryn Harper, senior bookseller at New York bookstore McNally Jackson, said. “Please and thank you go a huge way. Being rude to us or snippy to us is not going to make us go any faster. It’s not going to make the thing that’s out of stock magically appear.”
Harper joined other members of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union last month for a virtual news conference where they made a plea for the public's patience and self-control during the hectic weeks ahead.
“There’s a lot of disgruntled attitudes flying around this time of the year,” Cynthia Russo, who has worked at Bloomingdale’s in Manhattan for nearly two decades, said. “I try to kill them with kindness, but yet I take a firm stand with not being abused verbally, because that can happen and it’s sad. My favorite line is, ‘Let’s start over.'""
Dealing with a difficult person is never easy. These are other strategies that veteran workers use to defuse tense situations and to preserve their own peace of mind.
Taking a break for five or 10 minutes can help a worker who got yelled at to reset emotionally. If long lines or other duties don't allow for stepping away in the moment, the rattled employee could ask a colleague to take over temporarily or inform a manager of a need for a brief respite.
Fitting exercise into the day is hard in any line of work, but retail workers put in long hours during the holidays, making it even more challenging. Russo tries to power walk around each floor of Bloomingdale’s twice a day.
“I know I look crazy, probably, but I think my coworkers are used to seeing me do it,” she said.
At Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, Nicole Ray escorts passengers who need wheelchair assistance safely make it to their planes and back. She feels panicky when there aren’t enough wheelchairs or attendants to get the job done during busy periods.
The travelers she helps are kind for the most part, Ray says, but someone treats her with disrespect at least once a day. Such interactions often leave her in tears, she says. With two sons at home and extra side jobs to pay the bills, she has few opportunities to decompress.
If there's time between airport passengers, Ray escapes to a parking garage to breathe and listen to music. She copes with the unpleasant attitudes she comes across by expressing gratitude to friendly patrons, telling them “I really appreciate you being such a joy to be around and not being so hard on me.""
Staying calm in the face of an irrational customer can be challenging, but remembering that another person's unreasonable demands are not a reflection of you makes it easier to react skillfully.
“You have to understand that if people are impatient or they’re not in a good mood, obviously it has nothing to do with you,"" Tina Minshall, who is general manager at the Bridal and Formal shop in Cincinnati, said. “If you can respond in a pleasant way, it tends to de-elevate whatever is going on around you.”
Instead of reciprocating someone’s misplaced anger, try to be the one who remains composed, said Justin Robbins, founder of Metric Sherpa, a research and advisory firm that coaches businesses on training front-line employees.
You can say, “I’m here to help you resolve this,” or “I want to help you, but we need to keep this conversation respectful,” he said.
Maintaining an even keel can be especially difficult in customer call centers, where the pace of incoming complaints during the holidays is relentless and agents are often treated like punching bags.
Listening with empathy, without interrupting, goes a long way, said Melissa Copeland, founder and principal of Illinois-based Blue Orbit Consulting, which helps companies improve their customer service experience. After listening, repeat back what you’ve heard and explain the process you'll follow. Commit to what you can control, she said.
Smiling during tense interactions can make a difference. “It relaxes your face, and if you try and say something angry or be obnoxious while you’re smiling, it’s hard to do,” Copeland said. “It just helps with a quick reset.”
A sense of humor is a professional skill to cultivate during the holidays, said Carol Price, who has sold books, clothes and vitamins at shops in Fort Smith, Arkansas, for decades while holding down a full-time job at the local water agency. When the Christmas music in the stores where she works feels relentless and grates on her nerves, she sings along, sometimes changing the lyrics to “meow”.
Some customers hug Price when she helps them find what they need. By contrast, a man once threw books at her. She chooses to focus on the former.
“There’s nothing better than a kid asking for a book, and finding that book and handing it to them and seeing that look on their face,” Price said.
Supervisors can help lighten the emotional burden that comes with customer relations by giving employees to small treats, according to Harper, the New York bookseller. “You can’t pizza party your way up to worker protections, but it helps during holidays,” she said.
Stephen Yalof, CEO of shopping center operator Tanger, said managers also can work to reduce the stress on shoppers. Managers at Tanger's outlet malls and open-air centers use $25 gift cards to surprise customers or placate disgruntled ones.
“You’d be shocked what a gift card does to defuse a potential issue really quickly,” Yalof said.
If working conditions are unbearable, employees can band together to request improvements. Laura Kelly, an unaccompanied minor escort and wheelchair attendant with Prospect Airport Services, earns $12.50 an hour working at Charlotte Douglas International Airport and lives in a hotel with her two adult children.
During the holidays, there are more passengers to help but fewer workers because many quit or call in sick, Kelly said. She recently participated in a one-day Thanksgiving week strike to protest low wages.
“I’m just trying to help people get to where they need to go and just to keep a roof over my kids' heads and food in their belly,” Kelly said. “I don’t even have a way to relieve stress besides making sure that my kids are taken care of.""
Her advice to customers is to remember that service workers are human too.
“Just be loving and caring and put yourself in our place,” Kelly said. ”Just imagine if we were the passenger and you were pushing us around.”

2024-12-12,Apple's latest iPhones get the gift of more AI as holiday shopping season heats up,Apple is pumping more artificial intelligence into the latest iPhones during the holiday shopping season,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple is pumping more artificial intelligence into the latest iPhones during the holiday shopping season with a free software update that includes a feature that enables users to create customized emojis within a matter of seconds.
The Wednesday release of the iPhone's upgraded operating system, iOS 18.2, extends Apple's expansion into AI months after rivals such as Samsung and Google began implanting the revolutionary technology on their devices. The update builds upon another one that came out in late October to usher in the AI era for Apple and the iPhone, as well as for the iPad and Mac.
The latest round of AI tricks includes “Genmojis,” Apple's description for emojis that iPhone users will be able to ask the technology to create and then share. Apple says it is placing some limits its AI's emoji artistry to prevent the distribution of violent or hateful imagery. Other features include an “Image Playground” for a variety of AI-styled illustrations, writing tools and options for summarizing emails.
The technology won’t work on iPhones that Apple made before 2023 because it requires a special processor that isn’t in older models. The AI will work on the iPhone 16 line-up that came out in September and the premium iPhone 15 models released last year.
That exclusivity is expected to propel a cycle of iPhone upgrades during the current holiday shopping season into next year, driving up Apple's profit even higher from the $94 billion that the Cupertino, California, company pocketed in its last fiscal year ending in September. That expectation is the main reason Apple's stock price has climbed by about 30% so far this year to push the company's market value closer to the $4 trillion threshold for the first time.
Apple is broadening the AI suite's appeal by including English versions tailored for Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. that are included in the latest software update.
Although the iPhone's AI is similar to many of the features that have already been available from other companies, Apple is taking a slightly different approach to the technology in an effort to stand out from the rest of pack. It is emphasizing its ongoing commitment to protecting iPhone users' privacy by processing most of its AI on the device itself or corralling it in a secured data center. Users seeking more AI wizardry than the device or the special data center can handle will have the option to reach out to the popular ChatGPT technology made by OpenAI, which has forged a partnership with Apple.",,,,,,,,,,,,

2024-12-12,Google forges ahead with its next generation of AI technology while fending off a breakup threat,Google has unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Google on Wednesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence designed to tackle more of the work and thinking done by humans as it tries to stay on the technology's cutting edge while also trying to fend off regulatory threats to its empire.
The next generation of Google's AI is being packaged under the Gemini umbrella, which was unveiled a year ago. Google is framing its release of Gemini 2.0 as a springboard for AI agents built to interpret images shown through a smartphone, perform a variety of tedious chores, remember the conversations consumers have with people, help video game players plot strategy and even tackle the task of doing online searches.
In a blog post, Google CEO Sundar Pichai predicted the technology contained in Gemini 2.0 will “understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead and take action on your behalf, with your supervision.” It's a similar goal being pursued by hard-charging rivals such as OpenAI, with its chatGPT technology, and industry powerhouse such as Microsoft with a variety of similar tools on its Windows software.
A lot of Google's latest AI technology will initially be confined to test groups and subscribers who pay $20 per month for Gemini Advanced, but some features will be made available through its search engine and mobile apps. Google is planning wider releases next year that will include the technology popping up in its smorgasbord of free products, including its Chrome browser, digital maps and YouTube.
Besides trying to outshine OpenAI and other ambitious startups, Google is also trying to stay a step ahead of Apple as that trendsetting company begins to blend AI into its latest iPhones and other devices. After releasing a software update enabling the first bundle of the iPhone's “Apple Intelligence” features that spruced up the device's Siri assistant, another batch of the AI technology came out with a free software update that was also released Wednesday.
Google is pushing forward with its latest AI advances even as the U.S. Justice Department is trying to break up the Mountain View, California, company to prevent further abusive practices by its dominant search engine, which was declared an illegal monopoly by a federal judge earlier this year as part of a landmark antitrust case.
Among other things, Gemini 2.0 is supposed to improve the AI overviews that Google began highlighting in its search results over its traditional listing of the most pertinent links to websites earlier this year in response to AI-powered “answer engines” such as Perplexity.
After the AI overviews initially produced some goofy suggestions, including putting glue on pizza, Google refined the technology to minimize such missteps. Now, company executives are promising things are going to get even better with Gemini 2.0, which Pichai said will be able to engage in more human-like reasoning while solving more advanced math problems and even churn out some computer code. The improvements to AI Overviews will initially only appear to a test audience before a wider release next year.
The technological upgrade is also supposed to infuse a still-experimental universal AI agent dubbed “Project Astra,” with even more smarts and versatility, enabling people to have more meaningful and helpful conversations with the technology. In a show of confidence, Google said it will expand the number of people testing Project Astra without providing any specifics of the group's size.
As part of Gemini 2.0, Google is also going to begin testing an extension to Chrome called “Project Mariner,” which can be turned on to do online searches and sift through the results so people don't won't have to bother.
If the U.S. Department of Justice gets its way, Google will be forced to sell or spin off Chrome as part of its punishment for deploying its search engine in ways that stifled competition and potential innovation. Google has ridiculed the Justice Department's proposal as “overly broad” and vowed to resist any attempt to break up the company during federal court hearings scheduled to begin in Washington D.C. next spring.
Even if those proceedings culminate in a court order mandating a breakup, Google could still appeal in a process that could take years to resolve while it continues its AI expansion.

2024-12-12,Supreme Court allows investors' class action to proceed against microchip company Nvidia,The Supreme Court is allowing a class-action lawsuit that accuses Nvidia of misleading investors about its past dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency to proceed,"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is allowing a class-action lawsuit that accuses Nvidia of misleading investors about its past dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency to proceed.
The court's decision Wednesday comes the same week that China said it is investigating the the microchip company over suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws. The justices heard arguments four weeks ago in Nvidia's bid to shut down the lawsuit, then decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place. They dismissed the company's appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward.
At issue was a 2018 suit led by a Swedish investment management firm. It followed a dip in the profitability of cryptocurrency, which caused Nvidia’s revenues to fall short of projections and led to a 28% drop in the company’s stock price.
Nvidia had argued that the investors’ lawsuit should be thrown out because it does not measure up to a 1995 law, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that is intended to bar frivolous complaints. A district court judge had dismissed the complaint before the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that it could go forward. The Biden administration backed the investors at the Supreme Court.
“This is a win for corporate accountability. When corporations mislead shareholders, they undermine trust in our markets. Ensuring that investors can seek justice is essential to preserving fairness and transparency,"" Deepak Gupta, who represented the investors at Supreme Court, said in a statement.
In 2022, Nvidia, which is based in Santa Clara, California, paid a $5.5 million fine to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant source of revenue growth from the sale of graphics processing units that were produced and marketed for gaming. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.
Nvidia's recent performance has been spectacular. Even after the news of the China investigation, its share price is up 180% this year.
Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market’s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company’s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.
The lawsuit is one of two high court cases that involved class-action lawsuits against tech companies. The justices also dismissed an appeal from Facebook parent Meta that sought to end to a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-12,Apple rolls out new ‘Genmoji’,"The new feature, expected Wednesday, allows users to make their own custom emojis using artificial intelligence.","For one high school student in New Jersey, a single computer science competition fueled a mission to get more teenage girls interested in artificial intelligence, or AI.
Ishani Singh, now 17, was a freshman at High Technology High School in 2021 when she attended a state computer science competition, where she noticed she was only one of a few female students competing.
When Singh went onto compete in the regional competition, she said she was ""shocked"" to see that she was the only female student competing.
""I looked around and there were, like, zero girls, and I was like, 'OK,'"" Singh told ABC News in an interview airing on ""The Year: 2024,"" an annual special airing Dec. 26 on ABC. ""That felt a little weird.""
The experience inspired Singh, now a high school senior, to launch Girls Rule AI, which aims to empower young women to learn about AI, a term that, according to NASA, ""refers to computer systems that can perform complex tasks normally done by human-reasoning, decision making, creating, etc.""
Ishani Singh founded Girls Rule AI after attending a computer science competition where she was the only girl.

Since the start of the organization nearly three years ago, Girls Rule AI has taught free courses on AI to over 200 girls in 25 states and six countries around the world, including Kenya and Afghanistan, according to Singh.
Gloria Mwangi, a Girls Rule AI instructor in Kenya, said she believes women working in AI-related fields could be transformative.
""In Kenya, the interest in tech and AI is definitely growing,"" Mwangi told ABC News. ""I think AI has a lot of potential to make a difference for young women here.""
Singh added that the success of her company, she believes, has been in making AI more accessible to more girls.

2024-12-11,Rural resurrection: A Greek village leans into faith in fight against demographic collapse,"In the remote mountains of central Greece lies Fourna, a village in danger of disappearing due to its aging population","FOURNA, Greece -- Fourna, home to 180 people and hidden in the fir-tree covered mountains of central Greece, is a vanishing village that is determined to keep its place on the map.
A winding four-hour drive from Athens, it enjoys near total silence, periodically broken by church bells and howling dogs. Elderly residents measure the village’s chances of survival by the number of children enrolled at the local primary school.
Last year, there were only two.
But Fourna’s fortunes have been reversed by an unlikely and tireless partnership. The local schoolteacher, a Ph.D. student studying artificial intelligence, found common cause with the Rev. Constantine Dousikos, a burly Orthodox priest and former lumber machine operator who was ordained shortly before turning 50.
They started a despair-fueled campaign to attract families to Fourna, offering settling-in money raised from private donations and municipal programs.
It’s working: Two families have moved to the village, five more are on a 2025 wait list, and hundreds of others have made inquiries. Eight children now attend elementary classes.
Dousikos, equally at ease behind the wheel of his pickup or in front of the church altar, says the initiative was partly inspired by calls from the Orthodox church hierarchy urging clergy to promote family life.
“I think we did the obvious thing: Help the people here keep our village alive,” he says, standing in the Church of Transfiguration of Christ on the main square. “Of course, village life is not for everyone. You need to be good at manual work.”
Greece has one of the world’s oldest populations with 23% aged 65 or older in 2023, according to World Bank data. The central Greek region of Evrytania, home to Fourna, faces low birth rates and rural depopulation, with an average age of 56.2 – one of the three highest in the European Union.
Panagiota Diamanti, Fourna’s only elementary schoolteacher and co-founder of the family campaign “New Life in the Village,” says the urgency of the situation is palpable.
“If the kids don’t come, the teacher gets transferred and the school will close. And a closed school will never reopen,” she says. “We need bold action.”
More than 200 publicly run schools and kindergartens were shut down across Greece in the current school year due to low enrollment, many in remote parts of the country with sparse populations due to its mountainous mainland terrain and numerous small islands.
Several local authorities have reached out to the Fourna campaign, and asked Diamanti to help them start a similar program.
After class, she joins her eight students in a game of dodgeball at the school yard which overlooks Evrytania’s jagged mountains. The kids enjoy a local-celebrity status; their birthdays are often celebrated in the main village square.
Vassiliki Emmanouil relocated to Fourna with her six children – five sons and a daughter – and says she has been showered with kindness. Village residents leave food outside her door overnight and are encouraging her to restart an old bakery when her husband returns from a spell of work in Germany.
“I’ve been here for nearly three months, and I would be ungrateful to say I’ve struggled,” Emmanouil says. “The local priest and his wife treat me as if I’m part of their family. The entire village has been by our side, from offering daily essentials to emotional support.”
Deaths overtook annual births in Greece in 2010 as the country sank into a severe financial crisis and the numbers have steadily worsened since then, reaching almost double the birth level in 2022.
The conservative government last year created a ministry of family and social cohesion. It has increased family benefits in the 2025 budget and reached out to the Orthodox Church for help.
Last year, the church’s governing Holy Synod issued a circular that was read out at all of Greece’s Orthodox churches, arguing that financial incentives will not be enough to reverse the dire demographic trends.
“Experts propose various solutions to address the issue, emphasizing its significant social, economic, and geopolitical implications,” the message said.
“The Church underscores the spiritual dimension of family life, advocating for unity, love, and the creation of families as a testament to divine purpose,” it added. “Children, considered gifts from God, bring meaning to life and symbolize hope and renewal.”
For Fourna’s residents, even church attendance is tied to village survival. Two dozen churches in the area remain empty most of the year, but are well maintained and open for important dates on the religious calendar.
The appearance of children in church and on the village’s long-quieted streets caught most residents off guard.
“At the start, I never thought families would come to live here. It’s a remote village, very small, without much here,” local business owner Giorgos Vassilikoudis said.
“But to my surprise, families did come and they’re happy,” said Vassilikoudis, who runs a restaurant and guesthouse. “It’s very good for the village and for people who have shops and businesses. For other villages, it serves as an example. It’s a good start.”

2024-12-11,"What did you Google in 2024? From the elections to Copa América, here's what search trends show",Remember what you searched for in 2024,"NEW YORK -- Remember what you searched for in 2024? Google does.
Google released its annual “Year in Search” on Tuesday, rounding up the top trending queries entered into its namesake search engine in 2024. The results show terms that saw the highest spike in traffic compared to last year — ranging from key news events, notably global elections, to the most popular songs, athletes and unforgettable pop-culture moments that people looked up worldwide.
Sports — particularly soccer and cricket — dominated Google's overall trending searches in 2024. Copa América topped those search trends globally, followed by the UEFA European Championship and ICC Men's T20 World Cup.
Meanwhile, the U.S. election led news-specific searches worldwide. Queries about excessive heat and this year's Olympic Games followed.
U.S. President-elect Donald Trump topped searches in Google's people category this year — followed by Catherine, Princess of Wales, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, who also led athlete-specific searches. Meanwhile, the late Liam Payne, Toby Keith and O.J. Simpson led search trends among notable individuals who died in 2024.
In the world of entertainment, Disney and Pixar's “Inside Out 2” was the top trending movie of the year, while Netflix's “Baby Reindeer” led TV show trends. And Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” dominated song trends.
That's just the tip of the iceberg. Queries for the Olympic village's chocolate muffin, made famous by Norwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen over the summer games, led Google's global recipe trends this year. The New York Times' “Connections” puzzle topped game searches. And in the U.S., country-specific data shows, many people asked Google about online trends like the word “demure” and “ mob wife aesthetic.”
You can find more country-specific lists, and trends from years past, through Google’s “Year in Search” data published online. The California company said it collected 2024 search results from Jan. 1 through Nov. 23 of this year.
Google isn't the only one to publish an annual recap or top trends as 2024 draws to a close. Spotify Wrapped, for example, as well as Collins Dictionary and Merriam-Webster’s words of the year, have offered additional reflections for 2024.",, as long as human values, and by that I mean democratic liberal values in the classic sense of individual freedom, and respect for an individual are preserved, we should be OK.,,,,,,,
2024-12-11,GM to retreat from robotaxis and stop funding its Cruise autonomous vehicle unit,General Motors says it will retreat from the robotaxi business and stop funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle unit,"DETROIT -- General Motors said Tuesday it will retreat from the robotaxi business and stop funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle unit.
Instead the Detroit automaker will focus on development of partially automated driver-assist systems for personal vehicles like its Super Cruise, which allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel.
GM said it would get out of robotaxis “given the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.”
The company said it will combine Cruise's technical team with its own to work on advanced systems to assist drivers.
GM bought control of San Francisco-based Cruise automation in 2016 with high hopes of developing a profitable fleet of robotaxis.
Over the years GM invested billions in the subsidiary and eventually bought 90% of the company from investors, all while racking up millions in losses.
GM’s brushoff of Cruise represents a dramatic about-face from years of full-blown support that left a huge financial dent in the automaker. The company invested $2.4 billion in Cruise only to sustain years of uninterrupted losses, with little in return. Since GM bought a controlling stake in Cruise for $581 million in 2016, the robotaxi service piled up more than $10 billion in operating losses while bringing in less than $500 million in revenue, according to GM shareholder reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The automaker even announced plans for Cruise to generate $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, but it scaled back spending on the company after one of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts dragged a San Francisco pedestrian who was hit by another vehicle in 2023.
The California Public Utilities Commission alleged Cruise then covered up details of the crash for more than two weeks.
The embarrassing incident resulted in Cruise’s license to operate its driverless fleet in California being suspended by regulators and triggered a purge of its leadership — in addition to layoffs that jettisoned about a quarter of its workforce.
GM CEO Mary Barra told analysts on a conference call Tuesday the the new unit will focus on personal vehicles and developing systems that can drive by themselves in certain circumstances.
The company has agreements to buy another 7% of Cruise and intends to buy the remaining shares so it owns the whole company.
The move is another step back from autonomous vehicles, which have proved far harder to develop than companies once anticipated. Two years ago, crosstown rival Ford Motor Co. disbanded its Argo AI autonomous vehicle venture in Pittsburgh that it co-owned with Volkswagen.
At the time the company said it didn’t see a path to profitability for a number of years.
Yet other companies are pressing forward with plans to deploy autonomous vehicles and expanding their services.
Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo is accelerating plans to broaden its robotaxi service beyond areas of metropolitan Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Last week the company said it would begin testing its driverless Jaguars in Miami next year, with plans to start charging for rides in 2026.
The move comes less than a month after Waymo opened up its robotaxi service to anyone looking for a ride in an 80-square-mile (129 square kilometer) area of Los Angeles. Waymo also has plans to launch fleets in Atlanta and Austin next year in partership with ride-hailing leader Uber.
In April, a company called Aurora Innovation plans to start hauling freight on Texas freeways using fully driverless semis.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said his company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels using Tesla's “Full Self-Driving” system would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.
But an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into Full Self-Driving's ability to see in low visibility conditions cast doubt on whether Teslas are ready to be deployed without humans behind the wheel.
The agency began the investigation in October after getting reports of four crashes involving “Full Self-Driving” when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. An Arizona pedestrian was killed in one of the crashes.
GM said it will work with Cruise’s leadership to restructure the company and refocus Cruise’s operations on driver assist systems. The company expects the restructuring to reduce spending by more than $1 billion annually.
Cruise has about 2,300 employees and will retain a presence in San Francisco, GM said. It’s too early to talk about employment levels until the restructuring is completed next year, a spokesman said.
Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, said Cruise will bring its software, artificial intelligence and sensor development to GM to team up on improving GM’s driver-assist systems.
“We want to leverage what already has been done as we go forward, and we think we can do that very effectively,” Barra said.
Shares of GM rose about 3% in trading after Tuesday's closing bell. They are up about 47% for the year.

2024-12-11,OpenAI releases AI video generator Sora but limits how it depicts people,OpenAI has publicly released its new artificial intelligence video generator Sora but won’t let most users depict people as it monitors for patterns of misuse,"SAN FRANCISCO -- OpenAI has publicly released its new artificial intelligence video generator Sora but the company won't let most users depict people as it monitors for patterns of misuse.
Users of a premium version of OpenAI's flagship product ChatGPT can now use Sora to instantly create AI-generated videos based on written commands. Among the highlighted examples are high-quality video clips of sumo-wrestling bears and a cat sipping coffee.
But only a small set of invited testers can use Sora to make videos of humans as OpenAI works to “address concerns around misappropriation of likeness and deepfakes,” the company said in a blog post.
Text-to-video AI tools like Sora have been pitched as a way to save costs in making new entertainment and marketing videos but have also raised concerns about the ease with which they could impersonate real people in politics and otherwise.
OpenAI says it is blocking content with nudity and that a top priority is preventing the most harmful uses, including child sexual abuse material and sexual deepfakes.
The highly anticipated product received so much response upon its Monday release that OpenAI has temporarily paused the creation of new accounts.
“We’re currently experiencing heavy traffic and have temporarily disabled Sora account creation,"" according to its webpage.
OpenAI first unveiled Sora earlier this year but said it wanted to first engage with artists, policymakers and others before releasing the new tool to the public.
The company, which has been sued by some authors and The New York Times over its use of copyrighted works of writing to train ChatGPT, hasn’t disclosed what imagery and video sources were used to train Sora.

2024-12-10,"Still rockin': As a singer turns 80, the Christmas song she sang as a teen is a holiday staple",Brenda Lee's memories of recording “Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree” are a little hazy now,"NEW YORK -- Her memories of recording “Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree” are a little hazy. She remembers the producer placing decorations around the studio and blasting the air conditioner on a warm Nashville day to create a holiday spirit. The musicians, she recalls, nailed it in a couple of takes.
That's about it. After all, Brenda Lee was 13 years old at the time — and it was 66 years ago, in 1958.
Somewhat implausibly, her celebration of a “Christmas party hop” is more popular today than ever before. It's an unusual trajectory, even accounting for the fact that music listeners during the holiday season tend to embrace songs they've known for years.
“Rockin'” eclipsed Mariah Carey's perennial favorite “All I Want for Christmas is You” last December to top the Billboard music chart and make Lee, at age 78, the oldest woman to achieve that feat. A week later, following a birthday, she beat her own mark. Kendrick Lamar likely stands in her way of doing it again this year.
Another record: Sixty-five years represented the longest interval between a record being released and making it to No. 1.
“It is a good song,” Lee told The Associated Press. “It's a song that anybody can sing. You can join in, you can sing it, everyone is happy. I sure am glad that I have it. I never thought in my life that a Christmas song would be my legacy. But I'll take it.”
It's a phenomenon that music journalist Holly Gleason noticed recently while stopping for coffee in Florida. The song came over the loudspeaker and the room — parents, kids, hipsters — erupted in singing and laughter. “It's kind of an ear worm on steroids,” said Gleason, whose 2017 book “Woman Walk the Line: How the Women in Country Music Changed Our Lives” featured Lee, among others.
The song manages the neat trick of sounding retro yet not dated. Sweet guitar licks snake around Lee's voice in the original recording. Boots Randolph's saxophone solo drives it home. The party flies by quickly, the song over in two minutes, six seconds.
Composer Johnny Marks already had some seasonal hits to his credit, including “Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer” and “A Holly Jolly Christmas.” He specifically sought out Lee for his new song in 1958 and it's easy to see why: Who better to convey its innocence and spirit than a 13-year-old girl at the forefront of the Baby Boom? Rock ‘n’ roll was in its infancy then, too.
In the song, Lee sings about “mistletoe hung where you can see, every couple tries to stop.”
In real life, she hadn't experienced her first kiss. “Lord, no,” she said. “Not to say I didn't want to. I wasn't even allowed to date until I was 16.”
The song hits plenty of holiday reference points — pumpkin pie, caroling, boughs of holly. You can overlook the part of the chorus that doesn't make much sense: what is the “new old-fashioned way,” exactly?
The simplicity of “Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree” is a big part of its appeal, said Nathaniel Sloan, a musicologist at the University of Southern California and co-host of the “Switched on Pop” podcast. Like many successful holiday songs, it evokes nostalgia for a happier, more peaceful time — even if that's more imagination than reality, he said.
The style is more rockabilly than traditional rock or country, and Sloan believes that has much to do with why it continues to sound fresh.
“The thing that has always stunned me about the song is that you're listening to a 13-year-old's performance, and it doesn't sound that way to me,” he said. “There's a depth to the vocal, even a weathered quality, that I can't believe she was so young. It's pitch-perfect.”
For all of its success, the song was barely noticed upon its release in 1958. Not until two years later, when Lee's profile was higher through hits like “I'm Sorry,” did it make the music charts. Its biggest boost came 40 years after that, when “Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree” was featured in the hit movie “Home Alone.” The movie itself has become a holiday staple, giving more exposure to the song each year.
Her record company continues to push the song, recording a video in 2023 that included guest appearances by Tanya Tucker and Trisha Yearwood. This year it has released “Noche Buena Y Navidad,” a Spanish-language version using artificial intelligence to create a vocal derived from Lee's voice.
Universal Music is holding a party for her in Nashville to celebrate her 80th birthday on Wednesday. “She's just a force and a character,” said Cindy Mabe, the company's chairwoman and CEO. “She's full of spunk in the same way that 13-year-old girl was.”
“Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree” made the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2019. It has been streamed more than 2.5 billion times globally and certified seven times Platinum, meaning at least seven million copies sold. Kelly Clarkson, Miley Cyrus, Meghan Trainor, Kacey Musgraves and the duo of Darlene Love & Ronnie Spector are among the artists who've covered it.
Lee has sung it countless times over the years, most recently at a charity event last year. It made her concert setlist even in the heat of summer. How much money the song has earned is murky; the record company wouldn't talk about it. The bulk of its income would likely go to Marks' estate.
“It has never been a money thing for me,” Lee said. “It’s been a love thing. The money is great, yes, and I’m grateful. But I would be singing it on the corner for pennies because that’s what I love to do.”

2024-12-10,Stock market today: Wall Street slips to a rare back-to-back loss,"U.S. stock indexes drifted lower in the runup to the highlight of the week for the market, the latest update on inflation","NEW YORK -- U.S. stock indexes drifted lower Tuesday in the runup to the highlight of the week for the market, the latest update on inflation that’s coming on Wednesday.
The S&P 500 dipped 0.3%, a day after pulling back from its latest all-time high. They’re the first back-to-back losses for the index in nearly a month, as momentum slows following a big rally that has it on track for one of its best years of the millennium.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 154 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3%.
Tech titan Oracle dragged on the market and sank 6.7% after reporting growth for the latest quarter that fell just short of analysts’ expectations. It was one of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500, even though CEO Safra Catz said the company saw record demand related to artificial-intelligence technology for its cloud infrastructure business, which trains generative AI models.
AI has been a big source of growth that’s helped many companies’ stock prices skyrocket. Oracle’s stock had already leaped more than 80% for the year coming into Tuesday, which raised the bar of expectations for its profit report.
In the bond market, Treasury yields ticked higher ahead of Wednesday’s report on the inflation that U.S. consumers are feeling. Economists expect it to show similar increases as the month before.
Wednesday’s update and a report on Thursday about inflation at the wholesale level will be the final big pieces of data the Federal Reserve will get before its meeting next week, where many investors expect the year’s third cut to interest rates.
The Fed has been easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high since September to take pressure off the slowing jobs market, after bringing inflation nearly down to its 2% target. Lower rates would help give support to the economy, but they could also provide more fuel for inflation.
Expectations for a series of cuts through next year have been a big reason the S&P 500 has set so many records this year.
Trading in the options market suggests traders aren’t expecting a very big move for U.S. stocks following Wednesday’s report, according to strategists at Barclays. But a reading far off expectations in either direction could quickly change that.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.22% from 4.20% late Monday.
Even though the Fed has been cutting its main interest rate, mortgage rates have been more stubborn to stay high and have been volatile since the autumn. That has hampered the housing industry, and homebuilder Toll Brothers’ stock fell 6.9% even though it delivered profit and revenue for the latest quarter that topped analysts’ expectations.
CEO Douglas Yearley Jr. said the luxury builder has been seeing strong demand since the start of its fiscal year six weeks ago, an encouraging signal as it approaches the beginning of the spring selling season in mid-January.
Elsewhere on Wall Street, Alaska Air Group soared 13.2% after raising its forecast for profit in the current quarter. The airline said demand for flying around the holidays has been stronger than expected. It also approved a plan to buy back up to $1 billion of its stock, along with new service from Seattle to Tokyo and Seoul.
Boeing climbed 4.5% after saying it’s resuming production of its bestselling plane, the 737 Max, for the first time since 33,000 workers began a seven-week strike that ended in early November.
Vail Resorts rose 2.5% after the ski resort operator reported a smaller first-quarter loss than analysts expected in what is traditionally its worst quarter.
All told, the S&P 500 fell 17.94 points to 6,034.91. The Dow dipped 154.10 to 44,247.83, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 49.45 to 19,687.24.
In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in China after the world’s second-largest economy said its exports rose by less than expected in November. Stocks rose 0.6% in Shanghai but fell 0.5% in Hong Kong.
Indexes fell across much of Europe ahead of a meeting this week by the European Central Bank, where the widespread expectation is for another cut in interest rates.

2024-12-10,Taylor Swift wraps record-breaking “Eras” tour,"Taylor Swift’s record concert run came to an end last night in Vancouver, ABC’s Will Ganss and contributor Mike Muse take a deep dive into last night’s watch party in NYC and Swift’s global impact.","Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-10,Nvidia's stock dips after China opens probe of the AI chip company for violating anti-monopoly laws,Shares of Nvidia have slipped after China said it is investigating the high-flying U.S. microchip company over suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws,"Shares of Nvidia fell Monday after China said it is investigating the high-flying U.S. microchip company over suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws.
In a brief news release with few details, Chinese regulators appear to be focusing on Nvidia's $6.9 billion acquisition of network and data transmission company Mellanox in 2019.
Nvidia shares fell 2.6% Monday. They are still up 180% so far this year.
Considered a bellwether for artificial intelligence demand, Nvidia has led the AI sector to become one of the stock market’s biggest companies, as tech giants spend heavily on the company’s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.
Nvidia's shares have surged this year along with the California company's revenue and profit due to AI demand. According to data firm FactSet, about 16% of Nvidia's revenue comes from China, second only to its U.S.-generated revenue.
A spokesperson for the company based in Santa Clara, California, said in an emailed statement that Nvidia is “happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”
In its most recent earnings release, Nvidia posted revenue of $35.08 billion, up 94% from $18.12 billion a year ago. Nvidia earned $19.31 billion in the quarter, more than double the $9.24 billion it posted in last year’s third quarter. The earnings release did not break out revenue from China.
The company's market value rocketed to $3.5 trillion recently, passing Microsoft and briefly overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company.
China’s antitrust investigation follows a report this summer by technology news site The Information that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating complaints from rivals that Nvidia was abusing its market dominance in the chip sector. The allegations reported include Nvidia threatening to punish those who buy products from both itself and its competitors at the same time.
David Bieri, an international finance expert at Virginia Tech, said that China’s investigation is “not about what Nvidia is doing in China, per se” but rather a signal to the incoming Trump administration. China, Bieri said, is looking to set the tone of future relations.
The Chinese government, he said, is telling the U.S. “don’t mess with us, because all of your darling corporations that your version of capitalism needs to prosper have entanglements” with China.
Nvidia will have to revise its strategy in China or come up with provisions in their budgets for the type of uncertainty business with China will bring, Bieri said.
“I don’t think this is something that they can shake off,” he said. “I also have a tremendous amount of faith in the brilliance of the management strategy of a corporation like Nvidia to not only pay attention to credit risk, market risk and operational risk, but also to political risk.”
Nvidia’s invention of graphics processor chips, or GPUs, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics.
Last month, it replaced Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, ending the pioneering semiconductor company's 25-year run on the index.
Unlike Intel, Nvidia designs but doesn’t manufacture its own chips, relying heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., an Intel rival.

2024-12-09,NYC ad agency titans Omnicom and Interpublic to form $30 billion marketing powerhouse,Omnicom is buying Interpublic Group in a stock-for-stock deal that will create an advertising powerhouse with combined annual revenue of almost $26 billion,"Omnicom is buying Interpublic Group in a stock-for-stock deal that will create the largest ad agency in the world with combined annual revenue of almost $26 billion.
The names may be unfamiliar to many Americans, but some of their marketing campaigns are iconic. Those include “Got Milk” for the California Milk Processor Board, “Priceless” for Mastercard, “Because I'm Worth It” for L'Oreal and “Think Different” for Apple.
The combined company will be worth more than $30 billion.
“Through this combination, we are poised to accelerate innovation and harness the significant opportunities created by new technologies in this era of exponential change, said said John Wren, Chairman and CEO of Omnicom. “Now is the perfect time to bring together our technologies, capabilities, talent and geographic footprints to bring clients superior, data-driven outcomes.”
The company will keep the Omnicom name and trade under the “OMC” ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange.
The size of and reach of the new marketing giant will have multiple advantages, including the use of new technologies like artificial intelligence.
“We estimate both companies have an approximately 50/50 split between advertising and marketing services, setting up a strong position not only in creative and media, but also across areas like specialty healthcare, experiential, and PR,” wrote JPMorgan analyst David Karnovsky.
“For the industry, some amount of consolidation is a positive following a couple years of divergent growth among agencies and ahead of an investment cycle for Gen-AI,” Karnovsky added.
Shareholders of The Interpublic Group of Companies Inc. will receive 0.344 Omnicom shares for each share of Interpublic common stock that they own. Omnicom shareholders will own 60.6% of the combined company and Interpublic shareholders will own 39.4% after the transaction is complete.
Wren will be chairman and CEO of Omnicom, while Phil Angelastro will continue as as executive vice president and chief financial officer. Interpublic CEO Philippe Krakowsky and Daryl Simm will be co-presidents and chief operating officers at Omnicom.
Three current members of Interpublic's board, including Krakowsky, will join the board of Omnicom.
The deal is expected to have annual cost savings of $750 million and is expected to close during the second half of next year. It still needs the approval of Omnicom and Interpublic shareholders.
Shares of Interpublic jumped 10% Monday, while Omnicom's stock fell more than 6%.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-09,Stock market today: Nvidia drags Wall Street from its records as oil and gold rise,A slide for market superstar Nvidia helped pull U.S. stock indexes down from their records,"NEW YORK -- A slide for market superstar Nvidia on Monday knocked Wall Street off its big rally and helped drag U.S. stock indexes down from their records.
The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, coming off its 57th all-time high of the year so far. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 240 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite pulled back 0.6% from its own record.
Nvidia’s fall of 2.5% was by far the heaviest weight on the S&P 500 after China said it’s investigating the company over suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws. Nvidia has skyrocketed to become one of Wall Street’s most valuable companies because its chips are driving much of the world’s move into artificial-intelligence technology. That gives its stock’s movements more sway on the S&P 500 than nearly every other.
Nvidia’s drop overshadowed gains in Hong Kong and for Chinese stocks trading in the United States on hopes that China will deliver more stimulus for the world’s second-largest economy. Roughly three in seven of the stocks in the S&P 500 also rose.
The week’s highlight for Wall Street will arrive midweek when the latest updates on inflation arrive. Economists expect Wednesday’s report to show the inflation that U.S. consumers are feeling remained stuck at close to the same level last month. A separate report on Thursday, meanwhile, could show an acceleration in inflation at the wholesale level.
They’re the last big pieces of data the Federal Reserve will get before its meeting next week on interest rates. The widespread expectation is still that the central bank will cut its main interest rate for the third time this year.
The Fed has been easing its main interest rate from a two-decade high since September to offer more help for the slowing job market, after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. Lower interest rates can ease the brakes off the economy, but they can also offer more fuel for inflation.
Expectations for a series of cuts from the Fed have been a major reason the S&P 500 has set so many all-time highs this year.
“Investors should enjoy this rally while it lasts—there’s little on the horizon to disrupt the momentum through year-end,” according to Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide, though he warns stocks could stumble soon because of how overheated they’ve gotten.
On Wall Street, Interpublic Group rose 3.6% after rival Omnicom said it would buy the marketing and communications firm in an all-stock deal. The pair had a combined revenue of $25.6 billion last year. Omnicom, meanwhile, sank 10.2%.
Macy’s climbed 1.8% after an activist investor, Barington Capital Group, called on the retailer to buy back at least $2 billion of its own stock over the next three years and make other moves to help boost its stock price.
Super Micro Computer rose 0.5% after saying it got an extension that will keep its stock listed on the Nasdaq through Feb. 25, as it works to file its delayed annual report and other required financial statements.
Earlier this month, the maker of servers used in artificial-intelligence technology said an investigation found no evidence of misconduct by its management or by the company’s board following the resignation of its public auditor.
All told, the S&P 500 fell 37.42 points to 6,052.85. The Dow dipped 240.59 to 4,401.93, and the Nasdaq composite lost 123.08 to 19,736.69.
In the oil market, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rallied 1.7% to settle at $68.37 following the overthrow of Syrian leader Bashar Assad, who sought asylum in Moscow after rebels. Brent crude, the international standard, added 1.4% to $72.14 per barrel.
The price of gold also rose 1% to $2,685.80 per ounce amid the uncertainty created by the end of the Assad family’s 50 years of iron rule.
In stock markets abroad, the Hang Seng jumped 2.8% in Hong Kong after top Chinese leaders agreed on a “moderately loose” monetary policy for the world’s second-largest economy. That’s a shift away from a more cautious, “prudent” stance for the first time in 10 years. A major planning meeting later this week could also bring more stimulus for the Chinese economy.
U.S.-listed stocks of several Chinese companies climbed, including a 12.4% jump for electric-vehicle company Nio and a 7.4% rise for Alibaba Group. Stocks in Shanghai, though, were roughly flat.
In Seoul, South Korea’s Kospi slumped 2.8% as the fallout continues from President Yoon Suk Yeol ’s brief declaration of martial law last week in the midst of a budget dispute.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.19% from 4.15% late Friday.

2024-12-05,Putin's Ukraine drone barrages are increasingly backfiring on his closest ally,Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko thus far appears to have kept his nation out of the worst of the spiraling war engulfing his neighbors to the east and south.,"LONDON -- ""Europe's last dictator"" -- as Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has often been termed -- thus far appears to have kept his nation out of the worst of the spiralling war engulfing his neighbors to the east and south.
The 70-year-old provided invaluable material and political support for Russian ally President Vladimir Putin in his war on Ukraine, even offering Belarus as a launchpad for the doomed Russian drive towards Kyiv in the early stages of the full-scale invasion.
Since then, Russian forces have used Belarusian territory to launch ballistic missiles into Ukraine. Belarus houses bases at which Russian troops train for battle and hospitals where they recover.
Minsk even now hosts Russian nuclear warheads and Lukashenko brokered the short-lived settlement between the Kremlin and Wagner financier Yevgeny Prigozhin after the latter's ill-fated 2023 mutiny.

As the war in Ukraine escalated and the enmity between Moscow and its Western rivals deepened, Lukashenko's apparent hesitance to fully commit to the conflict seems to have bought him some level of freedom from retaliation.
But with Moscow's drone and missile barrages into Ukraine growing in scale and regularity, Belarusian opposition groups say the danger to their country is increasing.
The Belarusian Hajun Project -- an open-source intelligence group banned as an ""extremist"" organization by Minsk -- said a record-high total of 151 drones entered Belarus during November. At least three were shot down by Belarusian air defenses, it added.
One Russian attack in late November saw a record 38 strike drones cross into Belarus, the group said. ABC News could not independently verify the drone flights.
Neither the Belarusian Defense Ministry nor Foreign Ministry replied to ABC News' requests for comment.

Russian drones were first reported over Belarus in mid-July, their appearance then relatively sporadic. In October, the Hajun Project said it tracked a total of 49 Russian drones flying into Belarusian airspace across the month. The monthly total trebled by the end of November.
At least one drone landed and exploded in the southeastern Gomel Oblast, according to Ukrainian and opposition Belarusian media reports.
According to Ukrainian air force after-action reports, Russian drones enter Belarus near-nightly. The air force has noted that its evolving electronic warfare countermeasures play some role in the increasing number of Russian strike drones going off course.
Minsk has complained of Ukrainian drones violating its airspace. In July, Lukashenko himself demanded that Kyiv ensure ""comprehensive measures be taken to rule out any such future incidents in the future which could lead to further escalation of the situation in the region.""
In September, Belarus' military said it had downed foreign drones.
Chief of the General Staff Col. Sergei Frolov said drones were shot down without specifying their nation of origin. ""Timely actions by the air defense forces on duty destroyed all the violators' targets,"" he said in a statement quoted by the state-run Belta news agency.

Jonathan Eyal of the Royal United Services Institute think tank in the U.K., told ABC News that Lukashenko ""has always been very careful to calibrate the policy in a way that allows implausible deniability of any involvement in the Ukraine war -- and at the same time makes himself useful to the Russians.""
""He also knows that most of the Belarusian population has no interest in being dragged into the war at all,"" Eyal added, describing a ""balancing act"" in which the Belarusian leader has to at least pretend to be defending the nation's airspace.
""It's not a great secret that the Russians can do more or less what they want with Belarusian airspace,"" Eyal added. ""The idea that somehow the Belarusian military is determined to defend its sovereignty is a bit far-fetched.""
""These are very calibrated messages from Lukashenko trying to persuade people -- both at home and overseas -- that somehow he remains a complete master of his own destiny,"" Eyal said.
For Belarus' pro-Western opposition -- many now living in exile following Lukashenko's crackdown on the mass protests that followed the 2020 presidential election -- the drone flights are a sign of Minsk's weakness.

Franak Viacorka, the chief political adviser to Belarusian opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, told ABC News that drones ""are flying over Belarus practically every single night."" An average week sees 40 or 50 UAVs transit border areas, he said.
Viacorka said Lukashenko's government is working hard to hide any evidence of errant Russian munitions. ""It's very uncomfortable for them to say that the Russians are using our airspace,"" he said. ""It happens with the agreement of Lukashenko, or perhaps Russia doesn't even ask Lukashenko for permission.""
Aliaksandr Azarau -- a former police investigator who defected and now leads the opposition BYPOL group made up of former Belarusian security employees -- said government propaganda seeks to hide the problem while framing all intruding drones as Ukrainian.
""The concern is only for the people who see these drones above their heads near the Ukrainian border,"" Azaru said. ""The rest of Belarusians don't think about the drones -- it's not their problem.""
Official Belarusian reports of drones being intercepted, he added, are part of ""a political game."" Azaru even claimed that Belarusian military aircraft have held fire and flown alongside Russian drones, effectively escorting them into Ukrainian airspace
When a drone does fall on Belarusian territory, Viacorka said, ""the place is cleared immediately"" and any witnesses are pressed by security services not to reveal any details.
The issue, he added, is politically sensitive for Lukashenko. ""His narrative is that, thanks to him, Belarus has not gotten involved in war,"" Viacorka said. ""But when people see drones and shells flying over their territory, they see that Belarus is already involved in war.""

""It's very worrying that Belarus is getting more and more involved,"" Viacorka said.
Lukashenko and his Russian allies, he added, are ""putting more and more people in Belarus in danger.""
Russia's access to Belarusian airspace may also pose a threat to eastern NATO nations, three of whom -- Poland, Lithuania and Latvia -- border the country.
Russian freedom to act throughout Belarusian airspace has ""many implications"" for regional NATO states, Eyal suggested, as well as for western Ukrainian regions that will be more accessible for Moscow's Shaheds.
In September, Latvia's Defense Ministry reported that a Russian strike UAV crashed in the Rezekne region in the east of the country after flying across Belarus.

Since then, ""improvements in all levels of Latvian airspace surveillance have been made, as well as in decision-making and information exchange algorithms,"" a ministry spokesperson told ABC News. This includes the deployment of mobile air defense battle groups to the eastern Latgale border region, they said.
The procedures for NATO's Baltic air policing mission ""have also been clarified, allowing allied fighters to destroy aggressor drones entering Latvian airspace if necessary,"" the spokesperson added.
""Russia has control over Belarusian foreign and domestic policies,"" they continued. ""Belarus is an additional Russian military district, so the threat coming from Belarus is orchestrated by Russia. Unfortunately, it is not up to Belarus and its citizens to decide how Russia uses Belarusian airspace to achieve its aggressive foreign policy goals.""
""Hybrid warfare is already happening between Russia and the West,"" the ministry spokesperson said. ""Belarus is just a tool for Russian aggressive foreign policy. In the short term, Russia will continue to use a wide range of hybrid warfare tools to weaken Western countries and divide their unity.""
""The Belarusian regime's hybrid attack on the Latvian border with artificial migration demonstrates that we must prepare for all possible scenarios including violation of our airspace,"" they said.

Jeff Landry called it “game-changing” for his state's expanding tech sector, yet some environmental groups have raised concerns over the center's reliance on fossil fuels — and whether the plans for new natural gas power to support it could lead to higher energy bills in the future for Louisiana residents.
Meanwhile, Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, is expanding its existing supercomputer project in Memphis, Tennessee, the city's chamber of commerce said Wednesday. The chamber also said that Nvidia, Dell, and Supermicro Computer will be “establishing operations in Memphis,” without offering further details.
Louisiana is among a growing number of states offering tax credits and other incentives to lure big tech firms seeking sites for energy-intensive data centers.
The U.S. Commerce Department found that there aren’t enough data centers in the U.S. to meet the rising AI-fueled demand, which is projected to grow by 9% each year through 2030, citing industry reports.
Meta anticipates its Louisiana data center will create 500 operational jobs and 5,000 temporary construction jobs, said Kevin Janda, director of data center strategy. At 4 million square feet (370,000 square meters), it will be the company's largest AI data center to date, he added.
“We want to make sure we are having a positive impact on the local level,” Janda said.
Congressional leaders and local representatives from across the political spectrum heralded the Meta facility as a boon for Richland Parish, a rural part of Louisiana with a population of 20,000 historically reliant on agriculture. About one in four residents are considered to live in poverty, according to the U.S. census data. The parish’s unemployment rate was 4.6% last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Meta plans to invest $200 million into road and water infrastructure improvements for the parish to offset its water usage. The facility is expected to be completed in 2030.
Entergy, one of the nation's largest utility providers, is fast-tracking plans to build three natural gas power plants in Louisiana capable of generating 2,262 megawatts for Meta's data center over a 15-year period — nearly one-tenth of Entergy's existing energy capacity across four states.
The Louisiana Public Service Commission is weighing Entergy's proposal as some environmental groups have opposed locking the state into more fossil fuel-based energy infrastructure. Meta said it plans to help bring 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy onto the grid in the future.
Louisiana residents may ultimately end up with rate increases to pay off the cost of operating these natural gas power plants when Meta's contract with Entergy expires, said Jessica Hendricks, state policy director for the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a Louisiana-based nonprofit advocating for energy consumers.
“There’s no reason why residential customers in Louisiana need to pay for a power plant for energy that they’re not going to use,"" Hendricks said. ""And we want to make sure that there’s safeguards in place.”
Public service commissioner Foster Campbell, representing northeast Louisiana, said he does not believe the data center will increase rates for Louisiana residents and views it as vital for his region.
“It’s going in one of the most needed places in Louisiana and maybe one of the most needed places in the United States of America,” Foster said. “I’m for it 100%.”
Environmental groups have also warned of the pollution generated by Musk's AI data center in Memphis. The Southern Environmental Law Center, among others, says the supercomputer could strain the power grid, prompting attention from the Environmental Protection Agency. Eighteen gas turbines currently running at xAI’s south Memphis facility are significant sources of ground-level ozone, better known as smog, the group said.
Patrick Anderson, an attorney at the law center, said xAI has operated with “a stunning lack of transparency” in developing its South Memphis facility, which is located near predominantly Black neighborhoods that have long dealt with pollution and health risks from factories and other industrial sites.
“Memphians deserve to know how xAI will affect them,” he said, “and should have a seat at the table when these decisions are being made.”

2024-12-05,"'GMA' family unveils 2024 Christmas card, plus tips for your holiday photo cards","Take a peek at the 2024 ""Good Morning America"" family Christmas card!","The 2024 ""Good Morning America"" family Christmas card is here!
This year's card, taken by ""GMA"" stills photographer Heidi Gutman, features Robin Roberts, Michael Strahan, George Stephanopoulos, Ginger Zee and Lara Spencer and is inspired by a TikTok photo box trend.
The trend, which has gone viral on the social media platform in recent months, involves using a cardboard box as a DIY photo booth and photoshopping each individual photo booth snapshot together later in a grid format.
""It's our own version of 'The Brady Bunch,'"" Spencer said of this year's card. ""America, there you have it!""
The 2024 “Good Morning America” family Christmas card is inspired by a TikTok trend featuring festive photo boxes.
ABC News
Gutman said the photo box trend is easy to do at home and customizable with different props and string lights.
""This is so much fun. For this one, we use the iPhone … because just about everybody has a camera on their phone, so it's really easy to use,"" Gutman said. ""We use the non-LED lights with it, because it seems better with the iPhone, and then we use a ring light, set on a warm setting, to brighten up faces.""
The 2024 “Good Morning America” family Christmas card is inspired by a TikTok trend featuring festive photo boxes.
ABC News
If sending out holiday Christmas cards is still on your to-do list, these last-minute tips from Take Aim Photography owners Amy Trahant and Lisa Bousquet will have you taking your own picture-perfect photos in no time.
Pick the right location
The best location for photos is near a light source that illuminates people and the subjects. For example, face toward a sun-lit window instead of standing behind it.
""Location is one thing,"" Bousquet said Wednesday on ""GMA."" ""We tell people to get outside.""
""If you do stay inside, use the window as your light,"" Bousquet continued.
Choose comfortable clothes
When it comes to photo-worthy outfits, consider what you and your family's style is and what everyone likes to wear in the first place.
""It doesn't have to be stressful. Look at catalogs. I remember when I was first starting out, I thought it was going to be hard, and then I picked up a J. Crew catalog. I was like, 'Oh, they already did the homework. I can do that,'"" Trahant said.
""Look at Pinterest, look at Instagram, look all over the place. They're there. The work's already been done. Get inspired by it. You don't have to think so hard,"" Trahant continued.

Don't be afraid of AI
Artificial intelligence has changed the landscape of photography in recent years, and if you're interested in giving it a try, Trahant and Bousquet say to go for it.
""I love photography, but AI is here, and I'm embracing it,"" Trahant said. ""With a click of a button, I can turn myself into a Disney character. I do it to all my friends, bring [my iPhone] to dinner parties.""
Trahant receommends trying easy-to-use AI apps such as ToonMe and PicCollage.

Remember to pose and try adding props
Posing might not come naturally to everyone, but Bousquet and Trahant suggest keeping poses simple.
""We connect people,"" Bousquet said, demonstrating by putting her arm around her Take Aim Photography co-owner.
""We use props a lot,"" she added.
Trahant agreed. ""Props are just fun,"" she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,"Iowa State, SMU athletic directors trade barbs over CFP credentials",요약 없음,"Athletic directors at Iowa State and SMU are in a turf war over the latest College Football Playoff rankings, leading to a ""stay off my lawn"" moment on social media .
The background: SMU, at 11-1 and riding a nine-game winning streak into the Atlantic Coast Conference title game, was slotted at No. 8 in Tuesday night's latest ranking. Iowa State, meanwhile, is at 16th and playing for the title of the Big 12, which appears set to receive only one bid in the 12-team field that comes out Sunday.
Cyclones AD Jamie Pollard doesn't like that, and he  made his feelings clear on X, pointing out that SMU hasn't played Clemson, Syracuse, Georgia Tech or Miami -- four of the ACC's top seven teams -- and lost at home to BYU of the Big 12.
""Looks like your lawn may be artificial,"" Pollard wrote in a post directed to SMU's AD, Rick Hart.
Hart mowed down Pollard with a response of his own that started with ""respect you, but bad take.""
He compared nonconference schedules -- SMU's was better -- and pointed out the Mustangs have trailed for only about six minutes of their past nine games.
""I could go on ... Stay off my lawn!"" he posted.
Iowa State appears to be in a win-or-else mode, while SMU's fate is a little less clear.
If the Mustangs lose to No. 17 Clemson, the CFP selection committee will have to decide how much to penalize a team that made a title game, while others in contention did not. The choice could, for instance, pit SMU against Alabama, which is ranked 11th in this week's projected bracket.
Of course, some of these differences will be settled on the field Saturday. Pollard, the Iowa State AD, conceded as much by opening his salvo to Hart with this olive branch: ""Rick, beat Clemson Saturday and I will respect your ranking,"" he said.

The major deals to grab for Cyber Monday",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-12-03,Latest in feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar,ABC News contributor Mike Muse talks about the growing feud between rappers Drake and Kendrick Lamar.,"Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.
The Albertsons logo is displayed at an Albertsons supermarket on August 26, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.
Mario Tama/Getty Images
""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Cyber Monday might be more convenient if you're looking to avoid in-store crowds and shop from home. Amazon will likely be a popular destination for Cyber Monday sales, just as it has been in the past.
When are stores open after Thanksgiving?
Walmart will be closed on Thanksgiving Day 2024 for the fifth consecutive year. Other major retailers are also expected to be closed.
Check store hours for Black Friday openings or shop online if you prefer to avoid the in-store crowds.

2024-11-24,OneRepublic and Jelly Roll team up for new single 'Hurt',"OneRepublic released a new version of their hit single ""Hurt,"" featuring country star Jelly Roll.","Fans of OneRepublic have a lot to celebrate this week! The Grammy-nominated band just released a new version of their hit single ""Hurt,"" featuring country star Jelly Roll.
The original track first appeared on OneRepublic's latest album, ""Artificial Paradise,"" which dropped earlier this year.

The collaboration with Jelly Roll includes a new music video directed by Isaac Rentz, known for his work on OneRepublic's ""I Ain't Worried"" and ""Sink or Swim.""
OneRepublic also revealed plans for their Escape to Europe 2025 tour, which kicks off on Sept. 18, 2025, at Dublin's 3Arena and spans 27 cities across Europe, including stops in London, Paris and Berlin, before wrapping up in Lisbon on Nov. 16, 2025.
Jelly Roll, who has been busy with his ""Beautifully Broken North American Tour,"" recently earned nominations for Entertainer of the Year, Album of the Year and Male Vocalist of the Year at this year's Country Music Awards.
At the ceremony, which aired on Nov. 20, Jelly Roll performed an emotional rendition of Brooks & Dunn's 2005 hit ""Believe"" alongside the country duo, which earned him widespread praise as one of the night's standout moments.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-11-23,"Decorating early for Christmas can boost your happiness, even science shows it","Experts weigh in on the psychology of Christmas, design tips.","With Christmas near, bringing out the boughs of holly now -- even as you may still be putting fall decorations away -- may make you a happier person, experts say.
""For most people, decorating for Christmas reminds us of the best times in our lives,"" Amy Morin, a Florida-based psychotherapist and the author of ""13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do,"" told ""Good Morning America."" ""Thinking of those happy memories stirs up happy feelings.""
Part of the joy that can come from decorating for Christmas comes from nostalgia, which has been shown in studies to stir emotions and increase joy, according to Morin.
""When you're putting up decorations, you're thinking of happier times, times with family and friends and family traditions you engaged in,"" she said. ""For some people it’s bittersweet -- if family members are no longer here -- but it's still a way to connect.""

Another aspect of Christmas joy comes from the tradition of giving during the holiday season, explains Morin.
""Altruism increases in the month of December and as people start to give more and donate more, it makes them happy,"" she said. ""It makes people feel good so they want to start celebrating as early as possible.""

At least one study has also shown that decorating the outside of your home for Christmas can make you appear more welcoming and sociable.
""[Decorations] can lead to more positive conversations and they're an easy way to strike up a conversation,"" said Morin. ""It helps build a sense of community and belonging and all those things are associated with happiness too.""
Linda Baker, an interior designer and the owner of Baker Design Group, knows that well. She spends much of her year focused on Christmas, planning the holiday designs for her firm's commercial and residential clients.
""Christmas never totally stops for us. It’s pretty much year-round,"" she told ""GMA."" ""I do it because I love Christmas.""

Baker and her daughter, Heather Mattox, the firm's director of business, both said they see firsthand the delight their work brings to people.
""I’ve never had a client that doesn’t just love it,"" said Baker. ""We get emails and texts all through Christmas saying, 'Thank you, we’re loving it, it’s beautiful.'""
""It's a magical experience,” Mattox added. “We get to bring the magic of Christmas into their home.""
Clients now more than ever requesting that decorations be put up earlier -- even before Thanksgiving -- and taken down later in January, according to Baker and Mattox.
Get the most out of Christmas decorations
In order to make Christmas decorations last longer, Mattox and Baker follow these three tips that anyone can apply to their own home or business.
1. Go more natural.
Decorations that come from nature, like berries and pine branches and pine cones, give your house a holiday feel without as much ornateness, according to Baker.

The natural decorations deliver a scaled-down look that can work both before and after Christmas Day.
2. Don't skimp on an artificial tree.
Opting for an artificial tree is a no-brainer if you want to keep it up longer, but don't be afraid to make an investment, advises Baker.

A higher-quality tree may be more expensive in the short-term but will pay off in the future, as you can use it year after year and rely on it to keep its shape and lighting.
3. Use LED lights.
Baker's design firm uses LED lights on garlands and trees because they last longer and are more energy-efficient.

2024-11-22,Gaetz is out. Will Trump's other Cabinet picks be confirmed?,"Matt Gaetz has withdrawn, but will other Trump Cabinet nominees have trouble with confirmation?","Welcome to 538's politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited.
tia.yang (Tia Yang, senior editor): It's been a couple of weeks since the election, and the political world is gearing up for a second Trump term, with all the potential uncertainty and controversy that we know come along with it. President-elect Donald Trump has been steadily rolling out Cabinet picks — at record pace, no less. He's chosen several nominees so far who have more traditional backgrounds, like Sen. Marco Rubio as secretary of state, House GOP Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik as U.N. ambassador, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to lead the Interior Department and former Rep. Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.
But some of his other picks have raised eyebrows — and concerns among the senators who would have to confirm them. Just today, scandal-plagued former Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew from consideration for the attorney general post, citing his desire to avoid a ""needlessly protracted Washington scuffle"" over his nomination. We chatted today about what that withdrawal means, whether any of Trump's other nominees could be in trouble in the Senate, and what these confirmation battles tell us about the new Congress and Trump's relationship with it.
To start off, what do you make of Trump's nominations so far? What do they tell us about how he's approaching his second term?
geoffrey.skelley (Geoffrey Skelley, senior elections analyst): His nominations seem to suggest a desire to 1) choose loyalists who'll do his bidding, 2) pick some controversial outsiders as part of his efforts to bend Washington to his will and shake things up and 3) test Republican senators' commitment to his program by forcing them to digest some tough picks that they wouldn't like to confirm.
nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, senior editor and senior elections analyst): They tell us that Trump is going to govern exactly how he campaigned: without regard for norms or the way things are usually done. Gaetz for attorney general, anti-vaccine activist and former Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of health and human services, Fox News host Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense — these are not picks that a normal Republican administration would make.
geoffrey.skelley: Of course, Trump is largely the new normal for the GOP. But that's a larger conversation beyond administration appointees!
nrakich: We were also reminded that Trump loves a TV star! Three of his appointees to major positions — Hegseth, former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon (his pick for secretary of education) and physician Mehmet Oz (his pick to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) — are television personalities with no experience in elected office. (McMahon does have some government experience, leading the Small Business Administration during part of Trump's first term.) A fourth, secretary of transportation nominee Sean Duffy, is a former reality TV star turned congressman.
tia.yang: Yeah, these picks mostly have in common that Trump likes them and thinks they'll be loyal to him, as opposed to having the usual qualifications for their posts or any ideological consistency. But that's nothing new for him. And as Geoffrey alluded to, in a not particularly surprising move, these picks also present a loyalty test of sorts, especially as Trump has amped up the pressure on the new GOP majority (and its new leadership) to quickly confirm his nominees.
geoffrey.skelley: LOL, yeah, if you were truly surprised by any of this, you've been asleep for eight years.
tia.yang: Let's dig into some of those controversial nominees. Are any likely to suffer the same fate as Gaetz and fail to make it through the Senate confirmation process?
nrakich: Yeah, it's a really fascinating question. Republicans will have at least 52 seats in the next Senate, and probably 53, if Republican Dave McCormick wins the still-unresolved Pennsylvania Senate race, as most analysts expect. That's a decent-sized majority by modern standards, and most of those Republicans are loyal to Trump and likely to rubber-stamp all his picks.
But with some of these picks, Trump is also reallllly testing the boundaries of what some of the more establishment senators will go along with. We already saw that with Gaetz, who likely decided to withdraw because he saw the writing on the wall (there were reportedly at least a dozen Republican senators opposed to his nomination).
Of Trump's remaining nominees, I think Kennedy and Hegseth are also likely to be voted down or withdrawn. Those senators who aren't turned off by Kennedy's fringe, inaccurate views on vaccines will be turned off by his past support for abortion rights. And Hegseth has a scandal of his own — a woman accused him of sexually assaulting her in 2017.
geoffrey.skelley: Agreed that Gaetz was in the toughest spot. However, even after his example, I do think people may be too quick to assume that other contenders like Kennedy and Hegseth will fail or withdraw. For instance, Vice President-elect JD Vance was on the Hill today making the rounds in support of Hegseth.
tia.yang: Now that Gaetz is out of the picture, the attention will likely shift to Hegseth, Kennedy and others, and we'll get a better sense of what level of opposition is out there. Hegseth in particular could face opposition from ""defense hawk"" types, who may see Hegseth's inexperience, character and more extreme views as an issue when it comes to upholding national defense. A notable one is Sen. Joni Ernst — who was reportedly on the short list for the job herself.
And Kennedy is a complicated figure because Republicans have a slew of reasons they might oppose him. Beyond his stances on vaccines and abortion, and his storied history of conspiracy theories and scandal, he also holds discordant and controversial stances on food, drug and health regulations, including some that align him more closely with Democrats. In fact, reports say former President Barack Obama considered Kennedy to lead the EPA back in 2008 — but may have deemed him too controversial due to his arrest for heroin possession decades prior, and because he'd face conservative opposition for being too liberal! Oh, how the tables have turned.
geoffrey.skelley: With any of these controversial picks, much will depend on the Senate math. Assuming 53 Republicans, support from 50 of them plus Vance as a tiebreaker would be sufficient to confirm. So the question is, are there four Republican senators who will actually break with Trump? I do think it's going to be very hard for some Republicans to actually vote against Trump's nominees. There's the threat of primary challenges, including for a purple-state senator like Thom Tillis of North Carolina (already viewed as a squish by some on the right).
Either way, I expect almost all of Trump's nominees to get confirmed. Public snorting and private grumbling ≠ votes against nominees on the floor.
Of course, it is fair to wonder: With Gaetz gone, does that leave more room to oppose some of the other particularly controversial picks, like former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Kennedy?
tia.yang: Gaetz's withdrawal definitely could change the Senate calculus. Even earlier today, it didn't seem like a given. Trump and Vance were still lobbying hard for him as late as yesterday, and like you said, Geoffrey, the same is true for some of these other nominees. I think that's not just because of Trump's insistence on getting what he wants, but because even if he loses those battles, it could tire out the opposition to his nominees more broadly.
There's a history in the Senate of giving presidents and nominees the chance to withdraw if it becomes clear they don't have the support needed for confirmation. Regardless of whether that level of opposition materializes for nominees beyond Gaetz, Trump could keep pressing to force senators to choose sides. There's probably only so many times GOP senators can oppose his picks before raising his ire. They might have expended that quota on Gaetz had he stayed in.
nrakich: Yeah, ironically, I think the more of these outlandish nominees Trump picks, the better the odds are that his merely eyebrow-raising ones get confirmed. Gabbard, Oz, McMahon, etc. may not have the usual experience for the roles they've been nominated for, but they lack the salacious, stranger-than-fiction baggage of Gaetz, Kennedy and Hegseth. So Republican senators will feel more pressure to approve them so that Trump's entire Cabinet doesn't go down in a spectacular, Hindenburg-esque ball of flames.
geoffrey.skelley: To live in a world where being a favorite of Russian state media doesn't count as heavy baggage for someone nominated for director of national intelligence (Gabbard). But here we are.
nrakich: But that's the degree to which picks like Gaetz move the Overton window of outrageousness, right?
geoffrey.skelley: Yep, absolutely true. Trump is in something of a win-win in terms of the intraparty politics of selecting these controversial nominees. ""Well, if that one gets shot down, they'll probably confirm my other picks because they took out this guy they disliked. Or I'll get the people I want because the senators will give in."" Gaetz's withdrawal takes him out of the picture, but it still affects comparative perceptions of the other nominees.
tia.yang: Nathaniel, you said you think Kennedy and Hegseth are also likely to fail or be withdrawn. Geoffrey, do you disagree? You seem more skeptical that Senate Republicans will shoot down many, or any, of these nominees.
geoffrey.skelley: Well, it's true that any failures among these picks are more likely to end in withdrawals than actual defeat on the Senate floor. The last time the Senate actually voted down a nominee was in 1989, when the Democratic-controlled chamber rejected John Tower, a former senator from Texas, for secretary of defense. Tower's alcohol use and accusations of sexual misconduct hurt his bid, as did his contentious relationship with his former Senate colleagues (some of this bears a rough resemblance to Gaetz's situation prior to his exit).
Since then, though, 13 other nominees have now withdrawn rather than face a vote in committee or on the Senate floor.
nrakich: And I think that could be the undoing of some of these nominees, Geoffrey. If the Senate had to go on the record about each of these nominees, maybe Republicans — fearful of a Trump-backed primary challenger — would indeed all fall in line. But it probably will never get to that point. Instead, it'll just be incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune in a room with Trump telling him, ""We don't have the votes, you have to withdraw him.""
geoffrey.skelley: But see, I'm not sure Thune saying that is going to get Trump to back off. He runs the show for the GOP now, and this isn't 2017. The party is much Trumpier now, and if Thune wants to keep his job, he's gonna have to satisfy Numero Uno.
tia.yang: Yeah, this is straight into the deep end for the newly minted GOP leader. While Thune has of course committed himself to helping advance Trump's agenda, he doesn't have the rosiest relationship with the president-elect and was likely not Trumpworld's preferred candidate for this role. (The Trump loyalist contender seemed to be Sen. Rick Scott.)
Actually, the reaction to Thune's ascendance among Trump's supporters reminded me of the dynamic between MAGA Republicans and now-deposed House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and even current Speaker Mike Johnson, who is much more cut from the hard-right cloth than establishment figures like McCarthy or Thune. Of course, the Senate is not the House — I'm not suggesting Trump-aligned GOP senators will launch a coup against Thune or have the inclination to do so, but he's certainly already facing a huge amount of pressure from Trump and his allies. Navigating the confirmation process is just the first challenge.
nrakich: Fair — it will be interesting to see if Trump tries to forge ahead with votes on some of these nominees, even in the face of opposition, and kind of dare Republicans to go on the record against his picks.
It could backfire and make him look weak if they do. But it could also be a big victory for him if they capitulate.
geoffrey.skelley: In 2017, six Republican senators out of 52 voted against at least one Trump nominee. But no more than three voted against a given nominee at once. Three of those senators are gone: John McCain (deceased), Ben Sasse and Cory Gardner. The other three are still there: Collins, Murkowski and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Seems as if finding four no votes to stop some of these picks is really going to take some arduous math.
nrakich: I dunno, it's fairly easy for me to come up with at least four Republicans who aren't afraid to buck Trump.
Collins and Murkowski, the two most moderate members of the GOP caucus, are the obvious ones. But Sen. Todd Young of Indiana is also anti-Trump — he's just gotten a fraction of the attention for it. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana voted to impeach Trump, and he's the incoming chair of the committee that will consider Kennedy's nomination (although Cassidy actually sounds open-minded to him).
Finally, Sen. Mitch McConnell is an institutionalist through and through, and he's not going to run for reelection. What does he have to gain by voting for some of these nominees?
tia.yang: I think a potentially lame-duck McConnell could be a wild card. His private, sometimes-public dislike for Trump is well known, and Trump's recess appointments demands (which we'll discuss further later) particularly raised his hackles. Now that he's stepped down as Republican leader and seems very likely to retire in two years, the pressure is off. If he breaks with Trump on a given nominee, it could give other establishment-minded senators cover to do the same — though it's true that the universe of senators who would be willing to do so in the face of electoral pressure is small. The most likely suspects are those who are planning to retire.
Speaking of, the 2026 election cycle starts now! Twenty GOP-held seats will be up for reelection in two years, and those senators will have to weigh how bucking Trump affects their prospects in primary or general elections.
geoffrey.skelley: We're going to find out who is really running for reelection in 2026, I guess. Collins will need to buck Trump some to shore herself up in purplish Maine, but Cassidy — who seems to be running for reelection in his reliably red state — may not want Trump opposing him even more aggressively than after he voted to impeach. Young isn't up again until 2028, so he has more room to maneuver. But I'm dubious that someone like Tillis, even though he hails from a competitive state, will actually end up offering much opposition. He's bucked Trump before, only to shift positions in the face of MAGA backlash.
I will grant you McConnell, although the degree of his opposition remains to be seen — I mean, this was the guy who basically said Trump was responsible for Jan. 6 and then didn't vote for his conviction in the ensuing Senate impeachment trial.
nrakich: I'm with you on Tillis, Geoffrey — I think his deepest, darkest fear about the 2026 election is a Trump-backed primary challenger, not that he'll lose the general election. (To be clear, he very well might lose the general election — but I don't think voting for or against Trump's Cabinet picks two years earlier is going to make or break that.)
I'll also throw out Sen.-elect John Curtis, the mild-mannered Republican from Utah. Might he be the new Mitt Romney in more ways than one?
tia.yang: I was going to say the same. In addition to his relatively moderate voting record in the House, Curtis, like Romney, is Mormon — and there's a strong history of Trump skepticism among Mormon voters and prominent Mormon GOP lawmakers, like Romney and former Sen. Jeff Flake.
Needless to say, how this all shakes out could tell us a lot about Trump's standing with congressional Republicans in the coming term. And there's another somewhat unprecedented factor hanging over all their heads — Trump's calls for recess appointments, in which the president can unilaterally appoint nominees without Senate approval if the Senate recesses for at least 10 days (a time period established by a 2014 Supreme Court ruling).
It's a pretty weedy and somewhat arcane loophole, but Trump called for Senate Republicans to agree to it even before he made any of these appointments. How has that threat been playing out?
nrakich: I don't think it's very likely to succeed. Multiple Republican senators — including Tillis and McConnell, not just Collins and Murkowski — have already publicly come out against the idea of recess appointments. And yes, the idea of a recess appointment is to circumvent the Senate, but the Senate still has to give its implicit consent by adjourning and not holding what are called ""pro forma"" sessions — basically, sessions of Congress where they just gavel in and gavel out.
Now, Trumpworld is reportedly considering using a little-known clause in the Constitution to have Trump adjourn Congress himself so that he can make these recess appointments. But even conservative legal scholars have called that a ""cockamamie scheme.""
We know that Trump isn't afraid to break norms, so maybe he would try such a maneuver, as extreme an escalation of executive power as it would be. But even in the best-case scenario for him, it would get tied up in court.
geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, basically it would require Johnson and the House GOP to go along. The House would pass a resolution calling for the Senate and House to both adjourn. If the Senate didn't agree to that resolution, Trump could attempt to adjourn both chambers under an obscure part of Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, whereby the president may adjourn Congress ""in Case of Disagreement"" between the two chambers.
tia.yang: It’s clear 50 GOP senators aren’t on board with Trump’s initial demand. Many of them won’t vote in favor of recessing to literally abdicate the chamber’s constitutional responsibility of advice and consent.
And in the case of a forcible adjournment, it's unclear procedurally how the House forcing a disagreement would work — not to mention requiring maneuvering and cooperation from the very narrow GOP majority. That would be unprecedented, and the issue would almost certainly go to the Supreme Court, as Nathaniel mentioned.
nrakich: Yeah, I totally get the argument that most Republican senators are in Trump's thrall and will probably vote to give him whatever they want. But I have a hard time seeing many of them being OK with recess appointments. It really would neuter the power of the Senate, and these guys presumably got elected to the Senate because they wanted to exercise power!
tia.yang: To that point, I'd add that the fact that we are even talking about this is, honestly, bonkers. Even if it's only to signal their compliance with Trump, the fact that many GOP senators are publicly entertaining or calling for recess appointments shows just how effective Trump is at using public rhetoric to apply pressures to fellow Republicans in really unprecedented ways. The threat of a messy intraparty squabble — just when they’ve secured a federal government trifecta — is a pretty effective lever.
Recess appointments aren't something most Americans have heard about. That power existed in the first place to allow presidents to fill critical gaps at times that lawmakers couldn't get to D.C. fast enough by horse — not so they could bypass the Senate on wide swaths of controversial nominees. But Trump made the demand as if it was par for the course, and now it's in the public discourse.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-11-19,Google uses AI to make holiday shopping easier,ABC News’ Becky Worley shares how you can utilize Google’s artificial intelligence features when you do your in-store holiday shopping sprees.,"For one high school student in New Jersey, a single computer science competition fueled a mission to get more teenage girls interested in artificial intelligence, or AI.
Ishani Singh, now 17, was a freshman at High Technology High School in 2021 when she attended a state computer science competition, where she noticed she was only one of a few female students competing.
When Singh went onto compete in the regional competition, she said she was ""shocked"" to see that she was the only female student competing.
""I looked around and there were, like, zero girls, and I was like, 'OK,'"" Singh told ABC News in an interview airing on ""The Year: 2024,"" an annual special airing Dec. 26 on ABC. ""That felt a little weird.""
The experience inspired Singh, now a high school senior, to launch Girls Rule AI, which aims to empower young women to learn about AI, a term that, according to NASA, ""refers to computer systems that can perform complex tasks normally done by human-reasoning, decision making, creating, etc.""
Ishani Singh founded Girls Rule AI after attending a computer science competition where she was the only girl.
ABC News
Since the start of the organization nearly three years ago, Girls Rule AI has taught free courses on AI to over 200 girls in 25 states and six countries around the world, including Kenya and Afghanistan, according to Singh.
Gloria Mwangi, a Girls Rule AI instructor in Kenya, said she believes women working in AI-related fields could be transformative.
""In Kenya, the interest in tech and AI is definitely growing,"" Mwangi told ABC News. ""I think AI has a lot of potential to make a difference for young women here.""
Singh added that the success of her company, she believes, has been in making AI more accessible to more girls.

""I think it's just because girls are a little afraid to just start on this journey in the first place,"" Singh said of the gender difference in AI. ""So, I think by creating this community, I was able to make girls feel a little more more comfortable and just get them more confident in this field.""
Even with the progress, Singh said she feels there is a lot of work to do when it comes to getting girls interested in AI so they can go onto careers in the science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, industries.
According to the American Association of University Women, women currently make up 34% of the STEM workforce and are particularly outnumbered by men in fast-growing and high-paying fields like engineering and computer science.
""We're not at the level that we should be,"" Singh said. ""I think there should be more women in the tech field.""

Singh added that she believes the more young girls who become interested in AI, the greater the experience will be for all people who use the technology.
""If we have this growing surge of interest among girls and women in the field ... they'll be able to provide valuable input into the AI models that we're putting out into the world these days,"" she said. ""So, it's great to see that people have the same passion that I do.""

2024-11-19,Roblox announces new ways for parents to control kids' gaming experience,"Parents will now be able to monitor kids' activity remotely, on their own device.","Roblox on Monday announced new parental controls, including new ways for parents and caregivers to remotely monitor their child's gaming experience.
Using their own device, parents and caregivers can now modify how much time their child is able to play Roblox, lock down their child's private messaging options and choose the maturity level of the content their child can engage with, according to the new updates.
Roblox is also introducing a default setting that will limit users under the age of 13 to sending broadcast messages only.
With this new setting, users will only be able to send direct messages if a parent or guardian changes the default setting.

""So in a game, kids can still chat with one another in the game, but what we have turned off by default is one-to-one chat in the game experience itself,"" Tami Bhaumik, vice president of civility and partnerships for Roblox, told ABC News' Becky Worley in an interview that aired Monday on ""Good Morning America.""

Watchdog group says kids vulnerable to inappropriate content on popular game Roblox
To enable many of the new safety features, parents and caregivers need to make their own Roblox account and tie it to their child's account.
In announcing the new safety updates, Roblox said in a statement they were implemented after ""multiple rounds of internal research, including interviews, usability studies, and international surveys with parents and kids, and consultation with experts from child safety and media literacy organizations.""
The changes announced by Roblox -- which also include a new way of identifying mature content -- come after the company faced criticism from child online watchdog Common Sense Media that it can be easy for kids to see inappropriate content on the platform, including things sexual, racist, homophobic or antisemitic in nature.

In addition to taking advantage of the newly-announced safety features on Roblox, Common Sense Media advises parents and caregivers to play with their kids on Roblox in order to understand it the game and to be able to talk to their kids about what they're seeing and experiencing.

2024-11-17,"AI, North Korea, Trump: What Biden and Xi discussed in their final face-to-face meeting","President Joe Biden met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC conference in Lima, Peru -- their last meeting of Biden’s presidency.","President Joe Biden met with Chinese President Xi Jinping face-to-face Saturday afternoon on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in Lima, Peru -- their last meeting of Biden’s presidency.
They began their meeting with a handshake. During that moment, a reporter in the room asked how the leaders would discuss North Korea to which Biden responded, ""peacefully.""
Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan were on either side of the president as the meeting took place.

Leah Millis/Reuters
Xi spoke first, starting off by saying that it was a ""great pleasure"" to see Biden again. He added that the U.S.-Chinese relationship has ""gone through ups-and-downs,"" but indicated that over the course of the last four years it has stabilized.
Xi added that it's time to look at the past but to ""treat each other as partner and friend,"" rather than adversary. Xi added that stability in their relationship benefits the whole world and said that they should ""make the wise choice"" for the international community.
Xi: China is 'ready to work' with Trump
The Chinese leader didn't shy away from discussing the changing political landscape and spoke about the upcoming transition, with President-elect Donald Trump preparing to take the helm.

""China is ready to work with the new U.S. administration, to maintain communication, expand the cooperation and manage differences, so as to drive forward a steady transition of the China-U.S relationship for the benefit of the two peoples,"" Xi added.

Biden recounted the two decades long relationship the leaders have had, a relationship that has spanned Biden's time as vice president and as president.
""We haven't always agreed, but our conversation has always been candid and always been frank,"" Biden said. ""We have never kidded one another. We've been level with one another. I think that's vital.""
""These conversations prevent miscalculations, and they ensure the competition between our two countries will not veer into conflict, the competition, not conflict,"" he added.

Biden also hit on the points that senior administration officials previewed as major topics of conversation: cooperation on AI and joint counter-narcotics efforts. Biden noted that overdose deaths in the U.S. are declining for the first time in a decade.
A reporter in the room asked Biden whether he has any concerns about the relationship under Trump, but he did not respond. The same reporter asked Xi whether he had any concerns about tariffs that Trump has called for, but Xi did not respond.
AI and nuclear weapons -- and Biden's 'deep concern'
A readout of the call discusses some of the topics that Biden and Xi discussed during the bilateral meeting. The leaders discussed two areas where they found cooperation: Artificial intelligence safety measures and countering narcotics.
They made a notable agreement on AI safety: an affirmation for the need to ""maintain human control"" over the use of nuclear weapons.
""The two leaders affirmed the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons,"" the readout from the White House said. ""The two leaders also stressed the need to consider carefully the potential risks and develop AI technology in the military field in a prudent and responsible manner.""
But there were a couple of areas where the two leaders seemed to diverge in opinion — one of the major ones dealing with North Korea's recent deployment of troops to fight with Russia against Ukraine.
""President Biden condemned the deployment of thousands of DPRK troops to Russia, a dangerous expansion of Russia’s unlawful war against Ukraine with serious consequences for both European and Indo-Pacific peace and security. He expressed deep concern over the PRC’s continued support for Russia’s defense industrial base,"" the readout said.
Cross-strait issues also came up, with Biden calling ""for an end to destabilizing PRC military activity around Taiwan.""
Biden also talked about the need to ""resolve the cases of American citizens who are unjustly detained or subject to exit bans in China,"" according to the readout.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-11-16,Inside the tragic sinking of a tech mogul’s $40M superyacht off Sicily,"Tech mogul Mike Lynch, his teenage daughter Hannah and five others died when his $40 million luxury superyacht sank off the coast of Sicily in August 2024.","In August, a $40 million superyacht named the Bayesian set sail off the coast of Sicily. Its owner, billionaire tech mogul Mike Lynch, was celebrating a new lease on life with family and friends after winning a yearslong legal battle.
But triumph turned to tragedy early on Aug. 19, when the luxury vessel sank in the Mediterranean Sea. Lynch was among the missing.
In this July 19, 2007, file photo, Autonomy Corp Plc Chief Executive Officer Michael Lynch poses at his offices near Cambridge, U.K.

The 59-year-old was known as the British Bill Gates.
""I think it's more Steve Jobs,"" Reid Weingarten, who defended Lynch in court, told ABC News' Juju Chang, noting that some considered Lynch ""the grandfather of AI"" who ""completely changed the world with his brilliance.""
His first job involved mopping floors, but the math savant soon moved up in the world.
""He earned whatever he got, "" Weingarten said. ""And then, you know, went to Cambridge, and just by dint of his intelligence succeeded.""
Lynch's big break came in 1996, when he launched software company Autonomy, a pioneer in artificial intelligence. He rose quickly in the ranks of British society, becoming an adviser to then-British Prime Minister David Cameron and hosting members of the royal family at Autonomy’s headquarters.
Attorney Reid Weingarten compared Lynch to Steve Jobs.
ABC News
In 2011, Lynch sold Autonomy to U.S. tech giant Hewlett-Packard for $11 billion. The company later sued Lynch, alleging that he had inflated Autonomy's value by billions of dollars prior to the sale.
The lawsuit kicked off a saga that consumed the next decade of Lynch's life. He was extradited to the U.S., where he was put under house arrest and faced the possibility of dying in prison. In a turn of events, a San Francisco jury unanimously acquitted Lynch this past June.
He and his wife Angela were also the proud parents of two daughters. Lynch was eager to see 18-year-old Hannah as she prepared to attend Oxford University in the fall.
Sunday Times journalist Danny Fortson interviewed Lynch after the verdict, and told ABC News that being a father ""meant a lot"" to the businessman.
""He got really animated when he started talking about his daughters, and kind of this idea of making up for lost time,"" he said. ""And clearly this yacht trip was about that.""
Fortson’s interview with Lynch took place weeks before the tech mogul died.
Journalist Danny Fortson interviewed Lynch weeks before the tech mogul died.
ABC News
Lynch spoke about embracing his freedom in a podcast interview with Fortson.
""And so now it's very strange. You have a new life,"" he said in July. ""And that comes to the question you're asking me, which is what do you want to do with your new life?""
Lynch planned to celebrate his legal victory aboard his beloved boat, with those closest to him. It was a beautiful day when Lynch, Angela, Hannah, nine guests and 10 crew members boarded the superyacht the Bayesian from the coast of Italy, on Aug. 18.
Among the guests were Chris Morvillo, a friend of Lynch and a member of his legal team, and his wife Neda. The New York couple’s daughters were planning to meet them in Greece after the Bayesian’s tour ended.
The Bayesian’s aluminum mast was among the tallest in the world, standing at around 240 feet in the air.
""The mast looked like the Empire State Building in the middle of a sailboat,"" Weingarten said. ""It was huge.""
Family friend Susannah Gurdon lives near the Lynches in Suffolk, England, and vacationed with them several times.
""It was just thrilling,"" Gurdon told ABC News of her past trips on the Baynesian. ""It was like one of those old ships you can imagine from, you know, from history and this giant boat, as you build up speed, there's some wind, you know, you're tilting on one side.""
She noted that Lynch urged anyone who came on board to prioritize safety.
""One of the first things he does when you're a guest on his boat is, you're given a talk about safety. And he totally prioritized and respected the captain,"" Gurdon said. ""He made it very clear, no wandering about on the deck in the night and things.""
After several days of sailing on the Mediterranean, the trip was coming to an end. Sunday, Aug. 18, was the last full day of the trip, with guests planning to leave the yacht the following afternoon. While the vessel was at anchor in the bay near Porticello, a storm barreled through early the next morning.
Tracking data revealed how the Bayesian struggled at 3:50 a.m., with the winds seeming to send the superyacht zigzagging out of control. CCTV imagery showed the mast’s lights disappearing in the storm, and after 4:06 a.m. location data for the Bayesian cut out. The superyacht was fully submerged.
Within 16 minutes of being struck by what investigators believe was a downburst -- a strong downward wind system that gushes outward -- with winds of at least 60 mph, the Bayesian sank by the stern before tilting on its right side and plummeting onto the seabed.
In this Aug. 20, 2024, file photo, Italian emergency services head out to sea towards the area off the Sicilian coast, where the search continues for British technology tycoon Mike Lynch and his daughter Hannah, who are among six tourists missing after a luxury yacht sank in a tornado off the coast of Sicily.
Jonathan Brady/PA Images via Getty Images, FILE
Elizabeth Smith, a research meteorologist with the National Severe Storms Laboratory at NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), told ABC News that downburst winds are often mistaken for tornadoes.
""They can be quite severe and quite scary if you don't know what's going on,"" she said. ""The really destructive phase of a downburst is incredibly short. That's going to be when the initial strong winds arrive. And that will only last for a minute or so.""
The 22 people on board had to act quickly in the brief window of time before the Bayesian went under. Sailor Matthew Griffiths, who was on watch at the time of the sinking, told Italian authorities that he ""woke the captain up when the wind was blowing at 20 knots"" and that ""he ordered to wake everyone else up,"" according to Italian news service ANSA.
Griffiths noted the superyacht ""tilted and we fell into the water … we were then able to climb back on and we tried to rescue those we could,"" ANSA reported. He also said ""we were walking on the walls"" of the vessel.
Some of the people on board had to cling to a life raft after the Bayesian capsized. They were rescued by a nearby vessel, captained by Karsten Borner.
""After the storm was over, we noticed that the ship behind us was gone,"" Borner told Reuters. ""And then we saw a red flare so my first mate and I went to the position and we found this life raft drifting, 15 people inside.""
Among the survivors were nine crew members and six passengers, including Mike Lynch's wife Angela.
Lawyer Ayla Ronald and her partner Matthew Fletcher barely made it off, according to attorney Reid Weingarten.
""Ayla, I'm told she made it by ... seconds,"" he told ABC News. ""I mean she was the last one up on the deck.""
In this Aug. 22, 2024, file photo, the operations center for the Italian fire and rescue services is shown during search operations for the luxury yacht Bayesian, in Porticello, Italy.

Also among the survivors was Lynch's colleague Charlotte Golunski, who was tossed into the sea along with her 1-year-old daughter.
""I kept her afloat with all my strength, my arms raised so she wouldn’t drown,"" she told Italian newspaper la Repubblica. ""It was all dark, I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I screamed for help, but I could only hear the screams of others.""
Dr. Domenico Cipolla treated 1-year-old at the hospital, and told ABC News how close Golunski came to losing her to the sea.
""She momentarily lost hold of her daughter, who was carried off by the current,"" he said in Italian. ""After 2 or 3 seconds, she was able to recover her.""
Golunski's partner survived as well.
However, six passengers and one crew member were still missing -- Mike and Hannah Lynch among them.
Search and rescue teams descended on the scene, recovering the body of Recaldo Thomas, the ship's cook, near the wreckage.
Specialist divers had to go so deep that they could only stay under for about 12 minutes at a time, traversing through furniture and objects blocking access to cabins.
The bodies of the six missing passengers were all found in cabins on the left side of the ship. This area was closest to the surface, where air bubbles would have been concentrated, investigators noted.
Mike Lynch's body was found with the bodies of lawyer Chris Morvillo, his wife Neda Morvillo, Morgan Stanley executive Jonathan Bloomer and his wife Judy Bloomer in one room.
Hannah's body was the last recovered, discovered alone in a separate cabin.
Greg Morvillo lost his brother Chris and sister-in-law Neda when Bayesian sank.
ABC News
Autopsy reports showed that some of those who died had no water in their lungs, according to Reuters.
""They found an air pocket, they didn't drown,"" journalist Danny Fortson told ABC News. ""So that they were, you know, 100 feet down, 150 feet down, in the dark, in the cold, with just, you know, with a dwindling supply of oxygen.""
Greg Morvillo is haunted by the fates of his brother Chris and sister-in-law Neda.
""I think about the last few moments for them, on the ship all the time. It's haunting, it's terrifying,"" he told ABC News. ""And I cannot imagine what they were going through.

2024-11-16,RFK Jr. has been picked for HHS secretary. Here are the agencies he would oversee,"With RFK Jr. nominated for Secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services, these are all the agencies, including the CDC, that he would oversee.","Now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been picked by President-elect Donald Trump to be secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), the environmental lawyer could oversee a number of government agencies.
During a charity dinner last month in New York City, Trump pledged that Kennedy would ""go wild on health"" and that Kennedy ""wants healthy people, he wants healthy food.""
Many of Kennedy's health proposals have alarmed doctors and the public health community. Other policy proposals are seen as more reasonable, but public health officials have warned that Kennedy's exaggerated and sometimes unfounded claims about health risks could erode trust in doctors and health agencies.
Here are some of the agencies and offices that Kennedy would oversee if his nomination is confirmed by the Senate.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
The CDC's mission is to protect public health, alerting Americans about disease and working to prevent them from spreading illnesses.
The agency offers recommendations about vaccines, which often are adopted by states; tracks diseases and illnesses, including threats such as COVID-19 and foodborne illnesses; and provides information and tools to prevent disease, injury or disability.
While the CDC can influence local governments on health policies, it isn’t an enforcement agency and its recommendations are only guidelines. The one power the CDC does have, however, is that it can detain an individual at U.S. ports of entry or set rules on migration into the U.S. to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.
The CDC oversees 10 centers including the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities and the Global Health Centers.

Food and Drug Administration The FDA reviews the safety and efficacy of medical devices, medicines, and biologics, which are products that include vaccines, blood components and gene therapy.
The agency also regulates the safety of food, cosmetics, devices that emit radiation and tobacco products. It oversees eight centers and offices including the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and the Oncology Center of Excellence.
Kennedy has criticized the FDA and has claimed in interviews there are ""entire departments"" like the nutrition department that ""have to go"" because its workers are ""not doing their job.""
Kennedy has vowed to crack down on artificial food dyes and remove ultra-processed foods from school lunches, saying that diet can lead to chronic diseases.

3 popular gift picks you can’t go wrong with",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-11-15,"Review: 'Red One' is a big, bloated fiasco","Film critic Peter Travers reviews ""Red One,"" starring Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evans, Lucy Liu, Kiernan Shipka, Bonnie Hunt, Nick Kroll, Kristofer Hivju and more.","There's no doubt we all need a little Christmas now. But Hollywood fails miserably to deliver as promised with ""Red One,"" now in theaters where A-listers Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Chris ""Captain America"" Evans play the muscle out to save the jacked-up Santa Claus (wasted Oscar winner J.K. Simmons) from terrorist commando kidnappers.
It sounds like ""Die Hard"" revisited, which would have been great, since many of us rank that definitive mix of action and ho-ho-ho as their favorite entertainment to kick back with for the holidays. So what went wrong with all the elements in place? One word: everything.
Related Articles
'The War with Grandpa' review: Robert De Niro stars in 'unapologetically clownish' family film
For starters, ""Red One"" reportedly cost over $250 million to produce, and precious little of it shows onscreen as it zips around the world through supply closets in toy stores, from the beaches of Aruba to the Arctic Circle. You can feel the frenzy everywhere, but it's no fun.
Dwayne Johnson is shown in a scene from the movie ""Red One.""
Amazon MGM Studios
Johnson plays Callum Drift, the security chief at the North Pole. He's also an immortal who can shrink himself to elf size. Why? And why after 542 years of helping Santa and Mrs. Claus (Bonnie Hunt) does he want to retire? You'll enjoy ""Red One"" more if you stop asking logical questions.
The lame plot kicks into gear when Red One turns up missing two days before Christmas, and creatures from toy monsters to killer snowmen are running amok, even though Zoe Harlow (Lucy Liu) is meant to keep them in line as the head of a mysterious international agency.

Review: 'The Little Mermaid' belongs with the best of the live-action remakes
Zoe is not up to the job this time. So she calls in Evans as Jack O'Malley, a career criminal known as ""The Wolf,"" who seems to be suffering a mid-life crisis having to do with his estranged teen son Dylan (Wesley Kimmel). If anyone can track down Santa, it's Jack. The trouble is that Jack doesn't believe in Santa Claus, so how's he going to find someone who isn't there?
These are the jokes, folks. And for a while at least, Johnson and Evans turn ""Red One"" into a buddy comedy decent enough to bring a few smiles to undemanding audiences, preferably made up of the under-5 crowd.
Lucy Liu is shown in a scene from the movie ""Red One.""
Amazon MGM Studios
Working from a bungled script by Chris Morgan of the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise that has neither of those qualities, director Jake Kasdan, who guided Johnson through two rebooted ""Jumanji"" epics, seems to have let this big, bloated fiasco get away from him. Everything from the draggy pacing to the sleepwalking performances feels off.
The less said the better about the late entrance of the villain, the Christmas Witch Gryla, played by Kiernan Shipka, who was Don Draper's kid on ""Mad Men."" Gryla's ex is the dark lord of the holidays and Santa's no-account gargoyle of a brother, Krampus (Kristofer Hivju).
The special effects, including the giant reindeer (all girls) and the fantasy elements, are digitalized into a headache-inducing barrage of pixels. No wonder depressed Cal wants out. ""I love the kids, but the grownups are killing me,"" he moans. We see your point, buddy.
The alleged grownups behind ""Red One"" have indeed presented us with a Christmas miracle no one asked for: a movie that vacuums the joy out of the season. Artificial intelligence could have produced something more human. When it comes to finding a phrase to sum up this lump of coal trying to pass itself off as festive fun, old Mr. Scrooge said it best: ""Bah, humbug!""",,,,,,,,,,,,

2024-11-13,"Climate change threatening more than 40% of the world's corals with extinction, conservation group says","Climate change is decimating the likelihood of survival for a large portion of the world's coral reefs, according to new research.","Climate change is decimating the likelihood of survival for a large portion of the world's coral reefs, according to new research.
About 44% of global reef-building coral species are at risk of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species, a new version of which was released Wednesday amid COP29, the United Nations climate conference, in Baku, Azerbaijan.
MORE: 4th global coral reef bleaching event underway as oceans continue to warm: NOAA
The main threats to corals include annual severe bleaching events, pollution and the impacts of disease. Other threats include fishing activity -- especially bottom trawling -- deep-sea mining, drilling for oil and gas, or laying of deep-sea cables, according to the IUCN.
The finding is a sharp increase since 2008, the last time the conservation status of 892 warm-water reef-building coral species were assessed, when about one-third of the species were found to be at risk of extinction, according to the IUCN.

The main driver for the widened scope of risk is global warming, according to researchers, who used the most recent status update of coral reefs from the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network as well as a projected increase in warming events and major bleaching events for the assessment.
Two examples include the Staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) and Elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata), two critically endangered species in the Caribbean that have experienced significant declines due to increased warming, water pollution, hurricanes and the severe impacts of coral diseases, according to the IUCN.
MORE: Scientists are using underwater speakers to help restore degraded coral reefs: Study
Coral reefs have been experiencing massive health declines in response to unprecedented warm waters in recent years.
In April, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared the world's fourth global bleaching event.
A paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2021 found that coral reefs will stop growing in the next decade or so unless a significant reduction in greenhouse gases is achieved. A 2020 World Heritage Outlook report found that the Great Barrier Reef has deteriorated to 'critical' levels due to climate change.
NOAA's Coral Reef Watch predicts a 90% probability of coral bleaching heat stress in the next four months.

Researchers have devised creative solutions aimed at helping the reefs thrive.
In Australia, the world's largest seagrass nursery was unveiled on Wednesday. The installation, located off Gladstone, on the northeast part of the continent, aims to ""supercharge"" restoration of Great Barrier Reef ecosystems, according to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation.
MORE: Hawaii's coral reefs are in peril. What researchers are doing to restore coral ecosystems and preserve biodiversity
The purpose-built seagrass restoration nursery will also help to mitigate climate change by potentially storing 400 million tons of carbon -- the equivalent weight of eight Sydney Harbour bridges, according to the foundation.
""As the world grapples with how to meet urgent emissions reduction targets, we are increasingly looking to the ocean and its coastal ecosystems -- which sequester carbon 30-50 times more efficiently than rainforests -- for bridging solutions,"" said Great Barrier Reef Foundation Coastal Habitat Restoration Director Will Hamill in a statement.

Underwater speakers that play the sounds of a healthy reef, such as fish calls, were found to help coral larvae settle at rates up to seven times higher, according to a study published in Royal Society Open Science earlier this year.
MORE: 'Strikingly warm' ocean heat wave off Florida coasts could decimate corals, other marine life, experts say
Last year in North Carolina, 15 acres of 3D-printed artificial reef was installed to bolster the region's biodiversity and provide a skeleton for natural reef to grow.
""This is not just about preserving the spectacular beauty of coral reefs,"" said Beth Polidoro, IUCN Species Survival Commission Coral Red List Authority coordinator. ""Coral ecosystems also sustain coastal fishing communities, stabilise the shoreline and coastal habitats, and help remove carbon from the ocean, among other benefits.""

But major progress in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions remains the key to protecting coral reefs and global biodiversity as a whole, according to scientists.
""Climate change remains the leading threat to reef-building corals and is devastating the natural systems we depend on. We must take bold, decisive action to cut greenhouse gas emissions if we are to secure a sustainable future for humanity,"" IUCN Director General Grethel Aguilar said in a statement.
More research is needed on how corals react to warmer waters, the IUCN researchers said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,"Ecuador, Cincy player Marco Angulo dies from crash injuries",요약 없음,"Ecuador and FC Cincinnati player Marco Angulo has died from his injuries sustained in a car crash that also killed his former youth team teammate Roberto Cabezas, the Ecuadorian Football Association said on Tuesday.
The 22-year-old Angulo was a passenger in the car that crashed into a metal barrier on the Rumiñahui highway southeast of Quito on Oct. 7. The driver and Cabezas, who played for Independiente Juniors, were killed in the incident.
Angulo was left with serious head injuries and a lung contusion. He was placed in an artificial coma but died from the injuries on Monday night, the El Universo newspaper reported.
Angulo played for Ecuadorian league champion L.D.U. Quito on loan from MLS team FC Cincinnati.
Ecuador's FA said Angulo ""defended the colors of our country at every opportunity he had with his talent and dedication. Marco was not only an outstanding player, but a great teammate. He leaves a deep pain in our hearts.""
Angulo, a defensive midfielder, played for Ecuador Under-17s and Under-20s before making his senior debut in a friendly against Iraq in November 2022. He played in another friendly against Australia in March last year.
Angulo joined Cincinnati in December 2022 from Independiente de Valle in Ecuador and was part of Cincinnati's 2023 team that won the Supporters' Shield, playing in 24 matches and posting two assists. He was with LDU Quito the entire 2024 season.
""FC Cincinnati are heartbroken to share that Marco Angulo passed away Monday night after a battle with injuries sustained in an accident last month,"" a statement from FC Cincinnati said. ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of Marco -- a husband and father, a brother and son, a friend and teammate. He was a joyful, kind young man who lit up every room he entered. Our entire club grieves this tragedy, and we are thinking of and praying for his family. He was a cherished member of the FC Cincinnati family, and he will be missed.""
MLS also issued a statement on Tuesday.
""Major League Soccer mourns the tragic passing of Marco Angulo. Marco was a talented young midfielder for FC Cincinnati last season, helping the club capture the Supporters' Shield before continuing his development on loan with LDU Quito in his native Ecuador. During this difficult time, we extend our condolences to Marco's wife and son, as well as his entire family, friends, teammates and the soccer community. He will be greatly missed.""

2024-11-08,'The Right Stuff' spotlights artificial Christmas trees,Lifestyle contributor Lori Bergamotto shares her top artificial Christmas tree picks for every home and style.,"For one high school student in New Jersey, a single computer science competition fueled a mission to get more teenage girls interested in artificial intelligence, or AI.
Ishani Singh, now 17, was a freshman at High Technology High School in 2021 when she attended a state computer science competition, where she noticed she was only one of a few female students competing.
When Singh went onto compete in the regional competition, she said she was ""shocked"" to see that she was the only female student competing.
""I looked around and there were, like, zero girls, and I was like, 'OK,'"" Singh told ABC News in an interview airing on ""The Year: 2024,"" an annual special airing Dec. 26 on ABC. ""That felt a little weird.""
The experience inspired Singh, now a high school senior, to launch Girls Rule AI, which aims to empower young women to learn about AI, a term that, according to NASA, ""refers to computer systems that can perform complex tasks normally done by human-reasoning, decision making, creating, etc.""
Ishani Singh founded Girls Rule AI after attending a computer science competition where she was the only girl.
ABC News
Since the start of the organization nearly three years ago, Girls Rule AI has taught free courses on AI to over 200 girls in 25 states and six countries around the world, including Kenya and Afghanistan, according to Singh.
Gloria Mwangi, a Girls Rule AI instructor in Kenya, said she believes women working in AI-related fields could be transformative.
""In Kenya, the interest in tech and AI is definitely growing,"" Mwangi told ABC News. ""I think AI has a lot of potential to make a difference for young women here.""
Singh added that the success of her company, she believes, has been in making AI more accessible to more girls.

""I think it's just because girls are a little afraid to just start on this journey in the first place,"" Singh said of the gender difference in AI. ""So, I think by creating this community, I was able to make girls feel a little more more comfortable and just get them more confident in this field.""
Even with the progress, Singh said she feels there is a lot of work to do when it comes to getting girls interested in AI so they can go onto careers in the science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, industries.
According to the American Association of University Women, women currently make up 34% of the STEM workforce and are particularly outnumbered by men in fast-growing and high-paying fields like engineering and computer science.
""We're not at the level that we should be,"" Singh said. ""I think there should be more women in the tech field.""

Singh added that she believes the more young girls who become interested in AI, the greater the experience will be for all people who use the technology.
""If we have this growing surge of interest among girls and women in the field ... they'll be able to provide valuable input into the AI models that we're putting out into the world these days,"" she said. ""So, it's great to see that people have the same passion that I do.""

2024-11-08,Election integrity concerns fade after resounding Trump victory: ANALYSIS,"The U.S. election system passed a critical test, after months of widespread public concern about security of ballots, accuracy of the count, and timeliness of results.","It sustained relentless attacks on its integrity up until the moment a winner was declared.
In the end, the U.S. election system passed a critical test in 2024, after months of widespread public concern about the security of ballots, accuracy of the count, and timeliness of results.
""I hope we can lay to rest the question about the integrity of the American electoral system,"" President Joe Biden said in a national address Thursday. ""It is honest, it is fair, and it is transparent, and it can be trusted, win or lose. ""
To be sure, Biden (and most Democrats, according to polls) never doubted the integrity of the system. It was former President Donald Trump and his Republican supporters who for years embraced unsubstantiated conspiracy theories to believe the system is rigged.
Until polls began to close on Nov. 5, Trump was still raising unfounded claims of fraud. Then, suddenly, he dropped the subject when it became clear he would win.

MORE: Election fact check: How voting machines work and why they're hard to hack
State election officials nationwide -- members of both political parties -- have since resoundingly reported no systemic disruptions or signs of widespread fraud emerging in the general election.
""Battle-tested,"" declared Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was at the center of the partisan battle over 2020 election results. ""That just shows you the resilience of our system and our people.""
The relative seamlessness of the election process followed weeks of warnings about threats of interference by foreign adversaries, potential disruptions from artificial intelligence, armies of partisan poll watchers, and unprecedented pre-election litigation.
Election workers review ballots at the Denver Elections Division in Denver on Election Day, Nov. 5, 2024.
Chet Strange/AP
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is responsible for tracking threats to the vote nationwide, said there was ""no evidence of malicious activity impacting the security or integrity"" of the election and only ""minor"" disruptions from outside influences.
Non-credible bomb threats of suspected Russian-origin were lodged in at least four states, briefly disrupting operations in some places, but not derailing the vote.

Erica Dischino/Reuters
Equipment malfunctions and garden-variety human errors caused long lines and processing delays at a smattering of polling places nationwide; those happen every year.
Civil rights advocates cited only isolated instances of alleged voter intimidation or discrimination, despite a wave of new GOP-sponsored legislation in dozens of states tightening requirements for mail ballots and voter ID.
To many observers, the urgent efforts of patriotic and nonpartisan local election administrations to modernize voting equipment, improve transparency, and educate the public on procedures deserve credit for building trust.
Many of those election workers performed their duty in a highly stressful environment, often with their personal safety at risk.
They ""busted their necks and took risks,"" Biden said in his remarks. ""Thank them for staffing voting sites, counting the votes, protecting the very integrity of the election. Many of them are volunteers who do it simply out of love for their country.""
One measure of their success: the absence of lawsuits contesting vote procedures or election results processing and certification. After the most litigated pre-election period in history, neither party has any major pending post-election litigation in state or federal courts.",,,,,,,,,,,,

2024-11-06,Stock market surges on Election Day,Major stock indexes and large tech firms showed gains on Tuesday.,"The U.S. stock market climbed higher in trading on Tuesday, as voters rushed to the polls and the nation awaited the results of a closely contested presidential election.
The S&P 500 ticked upward about 1.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 400 points, jumping about 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 1.4%.
Gains at large tech firms are helping to boost the market. Shares of Nvidia, an artificial intelligence chipmaker, climbed nearly 3% in early trading.
At market close, tech giants Meta and Amazon had each seen shares rise about 2%.
MORE: What would a Kamala Harris or Donald Trump victory mean for the stock market?
The Nasdaq briefly halted trading of Trump Media and Technology Group Corp, the media company owned by former President Donald Trump. The stock price fell rapidly over a 15-minute period in the afternoon, dropping from $37 to $34. Shares ultimately closed at $33.94.
The overall market upswing follows a flurry of largely positive economic news over the past week. Government data released last week showed robust economic growth over a recent three-month period, alongside a continued cooldown of inflation.
U.S. hiring slowed in October, but fallout from hurricanes and labor strikes likely caused an undercount of the nation's workers, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data on Friday showed.
Ivan Feinseth, a market analyst at investment firm Tigress Financial, attributed the returns on Tuesday to eager anticipation among investors to move past the U.S. election.
""The nightmare of an endless election and a contentious battle has consumed a lot of the focus and attention. It's almost over. Then it goes back to the fundamentals of the market,"" Feinseth said.
The gains on Election Day extended a banner year for U.S. stocks. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have each climbed more than 20% this year while the Dow Jones is up about 11%.
The performance has owed to enthusiasm about artificial intelligence as well as resilient economic growth and expectations that interest rates would ease, Feinseth said.

The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate a half of a percentage point in September, dialing back its yearslong fight against inflation and delivering relief for borrowers saddled with high costs.
The Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates by another quarter of a percentage point when it meets on Thursday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment.
MORE: Trump proposes eliminating the income tax. Here's what experts think.
An expectation of interest rate cuts among investors often sends stocks higher, since lower rates pave the way for cheaper corporate borrowing and the potential for higher profits.
""The market looks toward the future, and the Fed is now on the side of the bulls,"" Feinseth said.
Over the full span of the next administration, the market will likely move higher whether the nation elects Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump, experts previously told ABC News. However, each candidate's policies could favor different types of stocks while posing unique risks, they added.
Trump has proposed a combination of low corporate tax rates and loose regulation that would likely bolster corporate profits and propel the stock market higher, experts said. Prices would likely increase under Harris, as they have under the economic stewardship of President Joe Biden, they added.",,,,,,,,,,,,

2024-11-01,Kristin Chenoweth shares her top 5 tips for holiday decorating like a pro,Use Chenoweth's tips to spark holiday decorating joy early this year.,"Beloved Broadway and screen icon Kristin Chenoweth is known for her incredible acting and singing skills, but she's just as clever when it comes to creating a cozy yet glamorous space at home for the holidays.
On Nov. 1, Chenoweth debuted a partnership with HomeGoods, unveiling the ""Deck the Everything Day"" campaign, an initiative meant to encourage those who love decorating for the holidays to do so guiltlessly and with joy. A HomeGoods survey found 60% of respondents had received critical remarks for decorating ""too early"" in the season and, rather than add to the stress that can come with that, the store and Chenoweth wanted embrace the idea that decorating should happen on your own timeline, free from outside criticism.
""For me, the holidays are all about family and creating new memories while cherishing our traditions from the past,"" Chenoweth said in an official ""Deck the Everything Day"" press release, noting that one of her favorite holiday rituals is ""wandering through the aisles of HomeGoods for decorating inspiration.""
While the store no longer sells its products online, one of the best gifts you can give yourself or a fellow HomeGoods devotee is a gift card, something that is still easy to buy and send via the web. This gives you or your recipient the perfect excuse to schedule a holiday excursion and browse the aisles with a seasonal latte or other beverage in hand -- the perfect way to kick off the season right.
For those who prefer to do their shopping at home, HomeGoods' sister stores TJ Maxx and Marshalls still sell plenty of holiday items online -- including many pieces you'll see below alongside Chenoweth's top five tips for creating Christmas magic in your home this season.

2024-11-01,"Top grocery stores offer deals on Thanksgiving meals, essentials","Walmart, Aldi, Target, Lidl and more retailers are offering deals on Thanksgiving grocery essentials for savings on the holiday feast.","With 28 days until Thanksgiving, the turkey countdown is on, and whether you're planning to feed a small family or a big crowd, there are plenty of ways to save on essential ingredients for the moveable feast with deals from a variety of retailers.
Retailers, grocery stores with Thanksgiving dinner deals
From grocery stores like Aldi and Walmart to big box warehouses like BJ's and Sam's Club, there are plenty of options to cook a complete holiday dinner this year that won't break the bank.
Aldi Thanksgiving dinner serves 10 for under $50
A thanksgiving meal spread using ingredients and products from Aldi.
ALDI
Aldi shared exclusively with ""Good Morning America"" earlier this month that it will offer its third-lowest-priced Thanksgiving meal in five years -- a basket of must-have items that serves a full meal for up to 10 people for under $47.
The offer is available now through Christmas at Aldi stores nationwide.
Save on Thanksgiving dinner at Walmart to serve 8 for $7 per person
Walmart recently unveiled its ""inflation-free"" Thanksgiving meal, which serves eight people for less than $7 per plate. The meal comes with 29 customer favorite holiday items, including turkey -- which comes out to just $0.88 per pound -- trimmings and dessert.
The holiday meal deal is available now through Dec. 25 and can be purchased in-store or online for pick-up or delivery, as early as 6 a.m.
Turkey and Thanksgiving trimmings for $20 at Target
Target announced a $20 Thanksgiving meal that feeds four people including a turkey and sides.
Target
The Minnesota-based retailer recently announced the return of its popular Thanksgiving dinner -- for $5 less than last year.
The $20 dinner feeds four people and includes all the traditional Thanksgiving favorites: a Good & Gather Turkey up to 10 pounds, Del Monte Cut Green Beans, Campbell's Condensed Cream of Mushroom Soup, Ocean Spray Jellied Cranberry Sauce, Heinz Home Style Roasted Turkey Gravy, Stove Top Stuffing Mix for Turkey, and Russet potatoes.
Turkeys start at 79 cents per pound, which is 20% less per pound than last year. Side dishes such as Good & Gather Cheddar Mac and Cranberry Goat Cheese and desserts including Favorite Day apple and pumpkin pies are all under $5.
Target's Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said in a statement that the company was ""serving up the kind of exceptional quality and value that sets Target apart"" by ""lowering the price of our Thanksgiving dinner menu to just $20,"" along with adding more Target Circle 360 offerings.
Order Thanksgiving dinner from Costco for less online
Costco members can pre-order the Fortune Gourmet Thanksgiving Turkey Dinner, which serves eight for $179.99 online with a $50 manufacturer's coupon and ships frozen second-day air via FedEx.
The meal, while pricier than some competitors, comes with larger portions of each side dish and enough for leftovers, including two desserts so people don't have to fight for their preferences, plus a 5-pound all natural, Amish-farm-raised, skin-on, pre-brined and netted turkey breast that's ready to roast.
The dishes are ""made with high quality ingredients"" and are ready to heat, bake, broil and serve in your favorite kitchenwares, according to Costco, which stated that ""family and guests will swear they are eating homemade.""
Other items included in the dinner: a 2-pound tray of mashed potatoes; 24 ounces of turkey gravy; a 2-pound tray of mac and cheese; a 2-pound tray of sweet corn; a 2-pound tray of green bean casserole; a 2-pound tray of St. Claire cornbread dressing/stuffing made with chicken broth, freshly diced celery, onion, sage and spices; 20 ounces of handmade cranberry relish with cinnamon and cardamom; 12 gourmet dinner rolls without preservatives, artificial colors or flavors; a 2-pound whole pumpkin pie; and a 2-poound tray of apple cobbler.

The new version, titled ""Noche Buena y Navidad,"" was produced by Grammy winner Aureo Baqueiro, who kept the original music and background vocals from the original version but replaced Lee's lead vocals with a new Spanish-language vocal created with SoundLab's AI MicDrop tool. It was released Friday.

""I am so blown away by this new Spanish version of 'Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree,' which was created with the help of AI,"" Lee said in a press release.
""Throughout my career, I performed and recorded many songs in different languages, but I never recorded 'Rockin'' in Spanish, which I would have loved to do,"" she continued. ""To have this out now is pretty incredible and I'm happy to introduce the song to fans in a new way.""

The UFC boss confirmed his conversations with the Meta CEO during an interview Thursday with TNT Sports.
""I could go on and on and on but I won't,"" White said. ""We literally had meetings this week to work on it. I actually talked to Mark Zuckerberg, too, about AI, so yeah. I'm totally going to fix the rankings. We're going to make a lot of strong moves here coming into 2025.""
White previously expressed his frustration with the current rankings that are voted on by a UFC-selected group of media outlets, a system that has been in place since 2013.
""I just can't handle incompetence,"" White said earlier this month. ""I just can't take it anymore. It's driving me crazy. I can't let people that I don't believe know what the f--- that they're talking about deal with the rankings anymore. I just can't do it. I have to figure out a solution.""

2024-10-25,Must-read books for 1st-year college students,"“The Book Case” podcast co-hosts, Kate and Charlie Gibson, share their top book picks that can help bring college students together in a divisive world.","For one high school student in New Jersey, a single computer science competition fueled a mission to get more teenage girls interested in artificial intelligence, or AI.
Ishani Singh, now 17, was a freshman at High Technology High School in 2021 when she attended a state computer science competition, where she noticed she was only one of a few female students competing.
When Singh went onto compete in the regional competition, she said she was ""shocked"" to see that she was the only female student competing.
""I looked around and there were, like, zero girls, and I was like, 'OK,'"" Singh told ABC News in an interview airing on ""The Year: 2024,"" an annual special airing Dec. 26 on ABC. ""That felt a little weird.""
The experience inspired Singh, now a high school senior, to launch Girls Rule AI, which aims to empower young women to learn about AI, a term that, according to NASA, ""refers to computer systems that can perform complex tasks normally done by human-reasoning, decision making, creating, etc.""
Ishani Singh founded Girls Rule AI after attending a computer science competition where she was the only girl.
ABC News
Since the start of the organization nearly three years ago, Girls Rule AI has taught free courses on AI to over 200 girls in 25 states and six countries around the world, including Kenya and Afghanistan, according to Singh.
Gloria Mwangi, a Girls Rule AI instructor in Kenya, said she believes women working in AI-related fields could be transformative.
""In Kenya, the interest in tech and AI is definitely growing,"" Mwangi told ABC News. ""I think AI has a lot of potential to make a difference for young women here.""
Singh added that the success of her company, she believes, has been in making AI more accessible to more girls.

""I think it's just because girls are a little afraid to just start on this journey in the first place,"" Singh said of the gender difference in AI. ""So, I think by creating this community, I was able to make girls feel a little more more comfortable and just get them more confident in this field.""
Even with the progress, Singh said she feels there is a lot of work to do when it comes to getting girls interested in AI so they can go onto careers in the science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, industries.
According to the American Association of University Women, women currently make up 34% of the STEM workforce and are particularly outnumbered by men in fast-growing and high-paying fields like engineering and computer science.
""We're not at the level that we should be,"" Singh said. ""I think there should be more women in the tech field.""

Singh added that she believes the more young girls who become interested in AI, the greater the experience will be for all people who use the technology.
""If we have this growing surge of interest among girls and women in the field ... they'll be able to provide valuable input into the AI models that we're putting out into the world these days,"" she said. ""So, it's great to see that people have the same passion that I do.""

2024-10-25,"Generative AI is disrupting creative communities, here's how they are fighting back","Generative AI is disrupting creative communities, here's how they are fighting back.","Generative artificial intelligence companies capable of generating creative content are also said to be disrupting the livelihoods of creatives around the world, according to a group of creatives speaking out publicly about the issue.
""The unlicensed use of creative works for training generative AI is a major, unjust threat to the livelihoods of the people behind those works, and must not be permitted, a "" statement signed by 11,500 actors, musicians, authors, photographers, and composers from across the world, read.
Julianne Moore, Kevin Bacon, Thom Yorke and Abba's Björn Ulvaeus, are among the tens of thousands of creatives who have signed this open letter calling for these companies to stop indiscriminately training on content they say should be licensed.

""This is a major issue for many of the artists, musicians, actors, authors, and other creators whose work is being exploited by AI companies,"" said Ed Newton-Rex, a former AI executive who released the statement.
A photo taken, Feb. 22, 2024, shows the logo of the Artificial Intelligence chat application on a smartphone screen.

As a former head of audio at Stability AI, Newton-Rex is well acquainted with the internal data training practices of generative AI companies. He resigned over the company's belief that training their AI models on copyrighted content without licensing it constitutes ""fair use.""
Generative AI models have generally scrapped as much content as they could from the internet, downloaded it and trained their model to be able to create new work that is in the style of the work it trained on, Newton-Rex told ABC News.
""None of this revenue is coming back to the original artists,"" explained Overlai founder Luke Neumann in a blog post about his new mobile app which aims to protect photography in the age of AI.
Neumann, who also signed the letter, launched the free app Overlai with world-renowned photographers Paul Nicklen and Cristina Mittermeier, when they noticed text-to-image generators could easily replicate the unique styles of both photographers. And, Neumann stresses the amount of work that goes into conservationist photography - the cost of travel and spending weeks, sometimes months in a location documenting a delicate ecosystem.

2024-10-23,What would a Kamala Harris or Donald Trump victory mean for the stock market?,The stock market has soared during the presidential campaign. Will it continue?,"The stock market has climbed over the course of the presidential campaign, raising questions about whether the rally will continue depending upon which candidate wins: Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump.
The S&P 500 has soared more than 20% this year, repeating a feat that the index achieved in 2023. The Nasdaq has jumped 23% this year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased 14%.
Over the full span of the next administration, the market will likely move higher whether the nation elects Harris or Trump, experts told ABC News. However, they added, each candidate’s policies could favor different types of stocks while posing unique risks.
Here’s what to know about what a win by Harris or Trump could mean for the stock market:
What would a Trump presidency mean for the stock market?
Trump has vowed to extend the corporate tax cuts signed into law during his first term when they begin to phase out in 2025. If approved by Congress and signed into law, the tax cuts would accompany an anticipated deregulatory agenda taken up by federal agencies within the Trump administration.
That combination of low corporate tax rates and loose regulation would likely bolster corporate profits and propel the stock market higher, experts said.
“Taxes do have consequences,” Peter Morici, a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland's School of Business, told ABC News. “With the Trump administration, it will be like a cork coming out.”
Trump policies would favor sectors such as oil and gas as well as artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, firms focused on renewable energy could suffer if Trump undermines financial incentives enacted under Biden, some experts said.
“The Inflation Reduction Act was a big deal for solar and electric vehicle stocks,” Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, told ABC News. “Who knows what will happen if that policy is walked back?”
Trump Media & Technology Group, the Trump-owned parent company of social media platform Truth Social, could rise in value if Trump takes office. Shares of the company have more than doubled in price over the past month as the former president has improved his standing in some polls.
However, while Trump’s policy proposals could boost the stock market, they also may threaten market performance, some experts said.
On the campaign trail, Trump has promised tariffs as high as 20% on all imported goods. Economists widely expect that such a policy would raise consumer prices. Trump has also voiced plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, which some economists say could cause a labor shortage.
Last month, Trump suggested invoking the military to tamp down what he described as the “enemy from within.”
“If he starts using the military domestically and imposes a 20% tariff and becomes a draconian, anti-democratic figure, it will weigh terribly on the stock market,” Morici said.

What would a Harris presidency mean for the stock market?
Stock prices would likely increase under Harris, as they have under President Joe Biden, but a potential hike in corporate taxes and robust regulatory enforcement could limit the gains, some experts said.
Corporations currently face a federal tax rate of 21%, which Harris aims to raise to 28%. Such a tax hike could hinder corporate profits and take some fuel out of the stock market, Reena Aggarwal, a professor of finance and director of the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, told ABC News. But, she added, it remains unclear whether the policy will ultimately become law.
“I don’t think this can happen that easily,” Aggarwal said. “It takes a long time.”
Aggarwal pointed to renewable technology as a sector that would benefit from policies under the Harris administration.
When asked about how the stock market would fare under Harris, Cox said the outcome would “come down to interest rates and earnings.”
The Federal Reserve typically raises interest rates in an effort to cool the economy and rein in inflation, but the policy often places downward pressure on stock prices.
The Harris campaign has put forward proposals to slow price increases for everything from groceries to prescription drugs to homes. Those plans include a federal ban on price-gouging and a focus on market concentration that the Biden administration says triggers high costs for consumers.
In the end, long-term stock market performance will likely depend on economic forces over which Harris, or any president, will exert limited control, Cox added.
“I don’t think Kamala Harris could enact changes that have long-term effects on the stock market,” Cox said. “If you’re a long-term investor, politics do not matter for your portfolio.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Choosing a tree
""When it comes to choosing a tree, the best type is one that resonates with your personality and decorating style,"" Kim told ""Good Morning America"" in an email. ""Other considerations are determining the space you'll be placing your tree -- do you have the space for a small tree or a tall one?""
""A good rule of thumb is to have at least 6 inches between the top of your tree and the ceiling,"" she continued. ""This also accounts for a topper or any decorative stand that adds height to the tree. So, if you have the standard 9-foot ceiling and a 12-inch angel topper, you'd want a 7.5-foot Christmas tree. We measure our trees from the stand to the topmost tip.""
Kim also pointed to factors like levels of realism, species, color and pre-lit trees versus unlit ones.
In terms of realism, Balsam Hill offers trees ranging from traditional to most realistic.
""PVC needles are flat and papery while polyethylene, or PE, needles have more dimension,"" Kim said. ""Some trees feature a combination of both -- the more realistic the tree, the higher the PE count.""

As with finding a real tree, the experts said you should consider the species that suits your style best, from spruces to pines as well as their colors (a noble fir has a grey tint to it, for example, whereas a blue fir leans blue-green).
Additionally, Boston recommended considering your intended decor.
""If you enjoy a heavily decorated tree, the type of tree is less important because you'll hardly see it,"" Boston told ""GMA"" in an email. ""If you enjoy more tree showing, pick an option that has wispy tips that extend past the branches.""
How to decorate your artificial Christmas tree
Boston said her favorite decorations for artificial trees are larger ornaments -- round baubles measuring 4 to 8 inches that ""fill the tree quickly."" Boston said she also adds ribbon for a ""touch of luxury"" and floral or themed stems inserted into the tree to ""add a layer of dimension and fill empty spots.""
Additionally, Boston suggested using real or faux cedar branches throughout the tree to make it look more realistic. ""The real branches will also give your tree the nostalgic Christmas tree smell,"" she said.
As for those with a green tree who want a snowy or flocked tree instead, she recommended adding flocked stems and sprays. ""This will give the illusion of a flocked tree and allow for either green or flocked in the future without having to purchase a second tree,"" she said.
To help save time, Boston recommended buying a pre-lit tree.

""After purchasing lights separately, you've now spent the same amount as a pre-lit tree, and you still have to spend an hour or more stringing the lights,"" she said.

2024-10-19,"'Beyond horrific' conditions in northern Gaza as hunger soars and supplies dwindle, aid organizations warn","International aid organizations are warning of ""beyond horrific"" conditions in northern Gaza with a lack of food and hospitals struggling to care for patients.","The situation in northern Gaza is ""beyond horrific"" as people experience intense levels of hunger and overcrowded hospitals struggle to care for patients amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, international aid organizations warn.
Last week, Israeli forces ordered evacuations of several regions in the north, including Beit Hanoun, Jabalia and Beit Lahia, as they work to surround Hamas fighters who are allegedly in the area.
Medical staff in the north say they are getting calls from all over northern Gaza asking for help, but ambulances are unable to reach the injured.

""The situation is beyond horrific and is very difficult and indescribable,"" Dr. Taghreed Al-Imawi, a member of the Palestinian NGO Juzoor for Health and Social Development and an OB-GYN doctor at Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, said in a statement. ""We have seen more than 23 pregnant women among the injured coming to the hospital since last week, wounded either by shrapnel or gunfire, suffering from fractures.""
Kamal Adwan was one of three hospitals that doctors say were ordered to evacuate last week, but medical staff have refused to do so. The Israel Defense Forces has not confirmed if hospitals were ordered to evacuate.

In an audio message sent in Arabic to ABC News, Dr. Eid Sabah, the director of the nursing department at Kamal Adwan Hospital, said the maternity ward is overflowing with children who were transferred from the ICU to accommodate the growing number of patients.
""Medical supplies are dwindling to nothing -- especially medical supplies related to surgery, maternity and critical care,"" he said. ""This is very dangerous and hard. The medical staff is exhausted and are not enough to cover critical patient care. They work 24/7 nonstop.""
He went on, ""We only have seven or eight beds in the critical care ward. This is terrifying. Patients on artificial respirators are suffering ... we emphasize that we don't have food. The medical staff can't eat, and they have to take care of suffering patients.""
Gazans in the north say they are cut off from access to food, medicine and clean drinking water, and are unable to feed their families.
""We have not gotten any food or water for the past 11 days, the suffering is getting worse by the day,"" Ismail, a father of two currently in the vicinity of Jabalia, said through the nonprofit organization CARE International. ""All the necessities for survival are lacking here in the north, no hospitals, no safe place, no safe drinking water, no medications for our children.""

A new report released Thursday from the U.N.-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification initiative warned that the risk of famine persists across the entire Gaza Strip, adding that the ""worst case scenario may materialize.""
If humanitarian aid delivery continues to be restricted, concerning levels of food insecurity and malnutrition will intensify, the IPC said.
The entire Gaza Strip has been classified as Phase 4 under the IPC, meaning there are large food consumption gaps that ""are reflected in very high acute malnutrition and excess mortality"" and that only emergency strategies can mitigate those gaps.
Nearly 133,000 people, or about 6% of the population, are classified as Phase 5, the highest stage of food insecurity. The report estimates the number of people classified as Phase 5 -- the equivalent to famine levels of starvation -- is expected to triple between November 2024 and April 2025, with the north and Rafah, on the southern border with Egypt, being the most affected.

Although there was a temporary surge in humanitarian aid being delivered between May and August 2024, September had the lowest volume of humanitarian supplies entering Gaza since last March.
""This sharp decline will profoundly limit food availability and the ability of families to feed themselves and access services in the next few months,"" the IPC report said.
The report also warned that about 60,000 cases of acute malnutrition among children ages 6 months to under 5 years old are expected to occur between September 2024 and August 2025 without significant intervention. Of those cases, 12,000 are predicted to be severe acute malnutrition.
The Israeli government has denied that conditions causing malnutrition exist inside Gaza and has said it works with international organizations to ensure necessary aid crosses the border into Gaza from Israel.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-10-18,AI deepfakes a top concern for election officials with voting underway,"State election officials in political battleground states say they are bracing for the unpredictable and emergent threat posed by artificial intelligence, or AI.","PHOENIX -- In the final weeks of a divisive, high-stakes campaign season, state election officials in political battleground states say they are bracing for the unpredictable and emergent threat posed by artificial intelligence, or AI.
""The number one concern we have on Election Day are some of the challenges that we have yet to face,"" Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said. ""There are some uncertainties, particularly with generative artificial intelligence and the ways that those might be used.""
Fontes, a Democrat, said his office is aware that some campaigns are already using AI as a tool in his hotly contested state and that election administrators urgently need to familiarize themselves with what is real and what is not.
Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, says the number one threat facing election officials in 2024 is the unfamiliar and unpredictable influence of artificial intelligence.
ABC News
""We're training all of our election officials, to make sure that they're familiar with some of the weapons that might be deployed against them,"" he said.
MORE: States are cracking down on deepfakes ahead of the 2024 election
During a series of tabletop exercises conducted over the past six months, Arizona officials for the first time confronted hypothetical scenarios involving disruptions on Election Day on Nov. 5 created or facilitated by AI.
Some involved deepfake video and voice-cloning technology deployed by bad actors across social media in an attempt to dissuade people from voting, disrupt polling places, or confuse poll workers as they handle ballots.
Arizona election officials convene in a hotel ballroom in May 2024 for a tabletop exercise on how to handle threats posed by artificial intelligence.
ABC News
In one fictional case, an AI-generated fake news headline published on Election Day said there had been shootings at polling places and that election officials had rescheduled the vote for Nov. 6.
""They walk us through those worst case scenarios so that we can be critically thinking, thinking on our toes,"" said Gina Roberts, voter education director for the nonpartisan Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Commission and one of the participants in the exercise.

The tabletop exercise also studied recent real-world examples of AI being deployed to try to influence elections.
Gina Roberts is the voter education director at Arizona Citizens Clean Election Commission, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization that promotes public confidence in the political process.
ABC News
In January, an AI-generated robocall mimicking President Joe Biden's voice was used to dissuade New Hampshire Democrats from voting in the primary. The Federal Communications Commission assessed a $6 million fine against the political consultant who made it.
In September, Taylor Swift revealed on Instagram that she went public to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris to, in part, refute an AI-generated deepfake image that falsely showed her endorsing Donald Trump.
There have also been high profile cases of foreign adversaries using AI to influence the campaign. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, says it shut down a secret Iranian effort to use its tools to manipulate U.S. voter opinion.
The Justice Department has also said that Russia is actively using AI to feed political disinformation on to social media platforms.
Lucas Hanson, co-founder of CivAI, says voters need to educate themselves on how to spot deepfake political images and audio fabricated with voice-cloning technology.
ABC News
""The primary targets of interest are going to be in swing states, and they're going to be swing voters,"" said Lucas Hanson, co-founder of CivAI, a nonprofit group tracking the use of A.I. in politics in order to educate the public.

""An even bigger [threat] potentially is trying to manipulate voter turnout, which in some ways is easier than trying to get people to actually change their mind,"" Hanson said. ""Whether or not that shows up in this particular election it's hard to know for sure, but the technology is there.""
Federal authorities say that while the risks aren't entirely new, AI is amplifying attacks on U.S. elections with ""greater speed and sophistication"" at lower costs.
State election officials who will oversee voting for the November general election prepare for disruptions from artificial intelligence during a training session in Phoenix, Ariz.
ABC News
""Those threats being supercharged by advanced technologies -- the most disruptive of which is artificial intelligence,"" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said last month.
In a bulletin to state election officials, the Department of Homeland Security warns that AI voice and video tools could be used to create fake election records; impersonate election staff to gain access to sensitive information; generate fake voter calls to overwhelm call centers; and more convincingly spread false information online.
Hanson says voters need to educate themselves on spotting AI attempts to influence their views.
""In images, at least for now, oftentimes if you look at the hands, then there'll be the wrong number of fingers or there will be not enough appendages. For audio, a lot of times it still sounds relatively robotic. In particular, sometimes there will be these little stutters,"" he said.

Social media companies and U.S. intelligence agencies say they are also tracking nefarious AI-driven influence campaigns and are prepared to alert voters about malicious deepfakes and disinformation.
But they can't catch them all.
More than 3 in 4 Americans believe it's likely AI will be used to affect the election outcome, according to an Elon University poll conducted in April 2024. Many voters in the same poll also said they're worried they are not prepared to detect fake photos, video and audio on their own.

In states like Arizona, which could decide a razor tight presidential race, the stakes are higher than ever.
""AI is just the new kid on the block,"" Fontes said. ""What exactly is going to happen? We're not sure. We are doing our best preparing for everything except Godzilla.

2024-10-18,'The Wild Robot' review: You'll be hooked from 1st scene to last,"""The Wild Root,"" captures the emotional connection between parent and child, according to film critic Peter Travers.","Family audiences rejoice! It's time to party with ""The Wild Robot,"" now in theaters nationwide and aglow with that special magic that only comes for a new animated classic that is spectacular in every sense of the word. You'll be hooked from first scene to last.
So what is this wild thing? Adapted from the first book in Peter Brown's open-ended series, ""The Wild Robot"" concerns a robot and a gosling? Not Ryan, but a baby goose in the care of a bot that a typhoon blew onto an island with no humans. Animals rule the roost.
That's frustrating for ROZZUM Unit 7134, aka ""Roz,"" a hulking metal biped who's been programmed as a people pleaser. Sublimely rendered by Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o who makes voicework and art form as Roz desperately looks to be of service to a human.
Roz ends up playing mom to Brightbill (Kit Connor of ""Heartstopper""), a newly hatched gosling whose nest Roz accidentally destroyed, along with his family, when she crashed onto the island. What's with animated films killing off parents? I'm still not over losing Bambi's mom.
A scene from the movie ""The Wild Robot.""
Dream Works
The tale being told here by skilled director Chris Sanders (""How to Train Your Dragon"") is about the human instincts growing in Roz and Brightbill, beautifully brought out by the actors and gorgeous animation that underlines this fable with something painterly and profound.

For laughs, we have a hilarious Pedro Pascal as Fink, the proverbial sly fox who denies Roz's offer of help while intuitively recognizing her power against predators and prey alike. The film introduces a parade of iconic animal characters, including the opossum Pinktail (Catherine O'Hara), the grizzly bear Thorn (Mark Hamill), and the beaver Paddler (Matt Berry).
""The Wild Robot"" never cheats on showing that nature can be terrifying as well as beautiful. Very young children may need comforting since death is a fact of life on this island. But the film's warm humor and tender feelings mitigate against the most dire of circumstances.
Roz's software allows her to decode the creature sounds around her, enabling her to talk to the animals like a droid Dr. Dolittle. And when Roz's metal leg is destroyed, a beaver gnaws her a new one out of a tree stump and the wild robot is born.
A scene from the movie ""The Wild Robot.""
Dream Works
The anti-AI crowd may be surprised by the way ""The Wild Robot"" argues for a truce between the natural world and artificial intelligence. But this gem of a movie makes a persuasive case.
As Brightbill imprints himself on his metallic mom, their bond seems unbreakable until Roz learns from an elder goose (Bill Nighy) that she must loosen the ties that bind so that her adopted son can join a mass migration flight that's essential to the survival of his species.

2024-10-18,ALS took a young mother's voice away. AI helped her regain it,"April Kerner was diagnosed with ALS in 2022 and soon lost her voice completely. Now, using an AI tool that sounds like her original voice, she can communicate again.","When April Kerner first started losing her voice, she wasn't sure she would be able to communicate with her family ever again.
Diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the disease not only affected Kerner's mobility but also her ability to speak.
However, thanks to artificial intelligence technology, the 42-year-old said she can successfully communicate using a program that sounds like her old voice.

""I cried the first time I heard it because it was actually my voice again,"" Kerner, who is a mother of three, told ABC News.
Kerner's symptoms began in April 2022, when she started experiencing weakness in her right leg. The following month, she had her first fall, on Mother's Day.
April began losing function of her extremities and soon her voice. By June 2023, her voice was completely gone. Pictured: April (second from left) with her children (from left to right) Ryker, Jax and Ava.

April and her husband, Bill Kerner, visited a slew of doctors over the next several months, including an orthopedic doctor, a spinal doctor and several neurologists, before she received her diagnosis three days after Christmas in December 2022: ALS.
ALS is a neurological disorder that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement and breathing.
As the nerve cells -- called motor neurons -- degenerate, they stop sending messages to the muscles. This causes the muscles to weaken and waste away, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.
ALS patients eventually stop being able to control voluntary movement, including walking, talking, and chewing, as well as breathing. The neurological disorders institute said ALS is a progressive disease, meaning the symptoms worsen over time.
April and Bill Kerner said the news was a shock to both of them.

""We knew something was going on, but we had always hoped it was something that was reversible because by November [2022], she wasn't able to walk, so we were hoping that it was anything, but ALS, really,"" Bill said. ""It was devastating, because we had so many plans. Our kids are so young. I mean, that was two years ago, so they were four and five at the time.""
One of the first things the Kerners did after they got the diagnosis was travel from their home in Frederick, Maryland, to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, with their three children – Ryker, Ava and Jax -- in April 2023 to make memories before April started to lose more function of her extremities.
By May 2023, April started to lose her voice. The next month, she went into respiratory failure and had to have a trach inserted, which took her voice away completely.
In a search for a method so April Kerner could still communicate, the Kerners learned about ElevenLabs, an AI audio research and deployment company that focuses on creating human-like text-to-speech programs.
The company asked if the couple could send in some recordings with her voice, Bill Kerner said. Using AI, ElevenLabs created a voice program that sounded very similar to April Kerner's original voice and not the robotic voice usually heard with traditional text-to-speech programs. April Kerner types what she wants to say with her eyes and the program generates a voice.

The program isn't perfect; for example, the cadence of the voice replica is a bit slow, according to the Kerners. However, it is the closest thing they've heard to her original voice.
""It's amazing. It's her actual voice,"" Bill Kerner said. ""We never thought we'd hear her actual voice again. It means a lot. … It gave us part of her that this horrible disease took away from her that we never thought would be again and, for that, we're so grateful.""
The Kerners said their children love hearing April's AI voice communicate with them and read them bedtime stories.
""They love it. The first time that they heard mommy's voice again, they all started jumping up and down … when they heard her, and they got excited,"" Bill Kerner said. ""And the stories that she does, the kids love it. They gather around. We have story time. They get excited.""
April said being able to tell bedtime stories to her children is also her favorite part of her AI voice.

""I can no longer sit and read a regular book to the kids, so this is a way for us to connect,"" she said.
Bill Kerner added that one of the things that bothers his wife the most is the lack of mobility, including not being able to hug her children without help, but the AI voice has given her back some independence.
April Kerner is currently on a ventilator and has a feeding tube, which she says makes every day a challenge. However, she is hopeful that by sharing her story, she can spread the word about ALS and its debilitating effects.
""Despite the difficulties I face, I am determined to keep fighting for my family and be there for my children,"" she said. ""They are my motivation to keep pushing forward, even on the hardest days.""

2024-10-17,"Biden will seek to shore up Ukraine support in Germany, senior administration official says","President Joe Biden will travel on Thursday to Germany, an overseas trip with it a sense of urgency as he seeks to make sure Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself.","President Joe Biden will travel on Thursday to Germany, an overseas trip that's expected to carry with it a sense of urgency, as the president seeks to make sure Ukraine has everything it needs to defend itself, a senior administration official told reporters on Wednesday.
The senior administration official made clear that Ukraine will be the primary focus of the trip, which comes in the final months of Biden's presidency and is also likely his last trip to Europe while in office. It also comes shortly before the U.S. elections that could drastically change America's role on the global stage.
The senior administration official talked about how Germany has been ""a critical partner"" to America's efforts to make sure Ukraine is equipped to fend off Russian aggression. The official said that the U.S. and Germany have been rallying support from other allies for Ukraine's war efforts.
""It has been the second largest provider of military aid to Ukraine after the United States, and has provided a number of high-end capabilities, including tanks and other artillery systems,"" the senior administration official said.

Biden on Friday will arrive at Berlin's Bellevue Palace to meet German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier for an official welcome ceremony. Biden will then deliver remarks at the Order of Merit Ceremony. Biden will go afterward to the Chancellery to greet Chancellor Olaf Scholz. They will then deliver joint statements to the press.
When asked whether there was a sense of urgency for this trip, the senior administration official said there is ""absolutely"" a sense of urgency.
""So absolutely, there is a sense of urgency in the White House and coming from President Biden's direction at the very top, to do everything that we can to put Ukraine in a position of strength and then ultimately to prevail in this conflict,"" the senior administration official said.
""I mean, this is not just a war about Ukraine's independence, its sovereignty, its territorial integrity and its democratic character, although it is all of those things, but above and beyond that, this is about the world order. It is about the principle that a stronger country cannot just invade another country by force of arms, violate its territorial integrity, violate the sanctity of its borders, and then engage in frankly, what are?"" the senior administration official added.
The senior administration official also mentioned that Biden would meet with leaders of other European countries to a range of issues related to the Israel-Hamas war.
""In terms of the quad meeting, quad leaders -- meaning the United States, the U.K., France and Germany -- will have an opportunity to discuss pressing global issues, including Ukraine, including the Middle East,"" the senior administration official said.
""It will certainly include a discussion of, as I said, building a sustainable diplomatic solution to the conflict, that includes the conflict between Israel and Lebanon, but then also escalation concerns regarding Iran and the region, and then also the situation in Israel Gaza. All of those are obviously interconnected in different ways, and I'm sure the leaders will have a chance to discuss that in detail and align their positions on the way forward,"" the senior administration official added.
Biden is also set to thank the Germans for the role that they played in the August prisoner swap that released American journalist Evan Gershkovich, former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan and others.
""Germany was also critical to securing the release earlier this year of 16 prisoners, including Americans and Germans from Russian and Belarusian custody, as I said earlier this year, that took significant political leadership, and because of that concerted effort and frankly, bold decision making, our citizens are home with their families and friends and some of Russia's most important distance are now living free,"" the senior administration official said.

The senior administration official was asked whether there is anything to the timing of the trip, which comes less than three weeks before the presidential election, and the official said it would not be ""a central talking point"" for Biden in his meetings.

2024-10-17,Kellogg's faces protests over food dyes in popular breakfast cereals,A closer look at why hundreds of people are protesting WK Kellogg over added food dyes in breakfast cereals sold in the U.S.,"Hundreds of people gathered outside the WK Kellogg headquarters in Michigan on Tuesday calling for the company to hold up its promise to remove artificial dyes from its breakfast cereals sold in the U.S.
Nearly 10 years ago, Kellogg's, the maker of Froot Loops and Apple Jacks, committed to removing such additives from its products by 2018.
While Kellogg's has done so in other countries including Canada, which now makes Froot Loops with natural fruit juice concentrates, the cereals sold in the U.S. still contain both food dyes and a chemical preservative.
In the U.S., Froot Loops ingredients include Red Dye No. 40, Yellow Dye No. 5, Yellow Dye No. 6 and Blue Dye No. 1.
Protesters carry signs through Battle Creek towards Kellogg's headquarters on Oct. 15, 2024
Becca Mahon/Battle Creek Enquirer /USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images
Food activist Vani Hari, also known as the Food Babe on social media, spoke to the crowd of demonstrators at the cereal giant's offices in Battle Creek on Tuesday.
""I'm here for the moms, all the moms, who struggle to feed their children healthy food without added chemicals,"" she said.
In response to the protests, Kellogg's insisted its products are safe for consumption, saying its ingredients meet the federal standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The agency has said that most children experience no adverse effects from color additives, but critics argue the FDA standards were developed without any assessment for possible neurological effects.
The protests come in the wake of a new California law known as the California School Food Safety Act that bans six potentially harmful dyes in foods served in California public schools. The ban includes all of the dyes in Froot Loops, plus Blue Dye No. 2 and Green Dye No. 3.
The bill was passed by state legislators in August and signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in September.
Studies suggest that consumption of said dyes and colorants banned under the new California School Food Safety Act may be linked to hyperactivity and other neurobehavioral problems in some children, as the California Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment outlined in a 2021 report.

While there are still thousands of chemicals allowed for use in our country's commercial food system, many of those that have been reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration have not been reevaluated for decades. Red 40, for example, was last evaluated for health risks in 1971.
Reports from the American Academy of Pediatrics align with this push to reassess the safety of artificial food coloring.
California previously made history in October 2023, when Newsom signed AB 418 into law, a first-of-its-kind bill that bans four harmful chemicals from candy, cereals, salad dressings and other processed foods in the state starting in 2027.
That law will end the use of brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben and Red Dye No. 3 in food products sold throughout the state.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-10-16,Protesters demand Kellogg remove artificial colors from cereals,Dozens gathered outside the company's headquarters Tuesday calling for the removal of artificial dyes from such cereals as Froot Loops after the company promised it would by 2018.,"Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-10-16,Parents sue school in Massachusetts after son punished for using AI on paper,The parents of a Massachusetts teenager are suing his high school after they said he was accused of cheating for using AI on an assignment.,"The parents of a Massachusetts teenager are suing his high school after they said he was accused of cheating for using an artificial intelligence tool on an assignment.
The teen's parents, Jennifer and Dale Harris, told Boston ABC affiliate WCVB their son used AI to assist with research for a history paper, but not to write the paper itself.
""They told us our son cheated on a paper, which is not what happened,"" Jennifer Harris told WCVB.
MORE: Back-to-school for higher education sees students and professors grappling with AI in academia
When the student's AI use was discovered, he was given detention, and his grade was negatively impacted, according to the family.
In a federal court filing, the family alleged the teen would ""suffer irreparable harm"" as a result of the incident, noting he was ""applying to elite colleges and universities given his high level of academic and personal achievement.""
As a result of the incident, he was barred from being inducted into the National Honor Society, the filing alleges.
The filing calls for the school to ""exclude any zero grade from grade calculations for the subject assignment"" and to ""immediately repair, restore and rectify Plaintiff Student’s letter grade in Social Studies to a grade of 'B.'""
Hingham High School is seen here.
WCVB
It also demands the student be ""retroactively appointed and inducted immediately"" into the National Honor Society.
The filing accuses the school of a lack of clarity in its rules about AI use, saying the school handbook did not ""have any established rules, policies or procedures for not only the use of artificial intelligence, but what any administrators, faculty or students should do when encountering its use.""
A copy of the school's handbook reviewed by ABC News states that ""unauthorized use of technology, including Artificial Intelligence"" may be deemed an act of cheating or plagiarism, but does not go into further detail about how it may or may not be used.
MORE: Data centers fuel AI and crypto but could threaten climate, experts say
The handbook defines plagiarism as ""unauthorized use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author, including Artificial Intelligence, and the representation of such as one’s own work.""
A teacher who uncovers instances of cheating must ""record a failing grade for that assignment for each student involved"" and inform the student's parents, according to the handbook. The teacher must also notify the assistant principal, ""who will add the information to the student’s disciplinary file"" and ""may take further action if they deem it warranted,"" the handbook states.
Jennifer Harris urged the school to clarify their rules surrounding the use of AI.
""I'd also like them to put in place an AI policy that makes sense -- that the teachers understand that they then can articulate to the students,"" she said.
The filing also called for school administrators to ""undergo training in the use and implementation of artificial intelligence in the classroom, schools and educational environment by a duly qualified third party not employed by the District.""
In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for the school district declined to comment on the matter.
""To respect the privacy of the student involved and due to ongoing litigation, [Hingham Public Schools] is unable to provide further details at this time,"" the spokesperson said.",, or if you just want one glass of wine and to save the bottle for another day.

2024-10-09,Generation Alpha: Why are we talking about them?,Generation Alpha includes those born in 2010 and onward.,"Generation Alpha, the youngest generation, born between 2010 and 2024, is quickly emerging as an influential demographic and is poised to shape society like never before.
While the world is gaining a clearer understanding of Generation Z as they continue to make their way into society, we are still in the early stages of discovering the full character and potential of Gen Alpha.

After Gen Z, meet Gen Alpha. What to know about the generation born 2010 to today
Described by experts as ""mini-millennials,"" they are a generation that was born into technology and have witnessed history happening, from the coronavirus pandemic to the introduction of artificial intelligence.
To learn more about Gen Alpha, ""Good Morning America"" spoke to subject experts Heather Dretsch, who is an assistant professor of marketing at North Carolina State University, and Kathy Sheehan, who serves as senior vice president and global director at Cassandra, an insights and cultural strategy group.
What to know about Gen Alpha
ABC News Photo Illustration by Katrina Stapleton, Adobe
What is Gen Alpha?
The term ""Gen Alpha"" was coined by social researcher and futurist Mark McCrindle, and according to McCrindle, refers to anyone who was born in 2010 and onward. The oldest among Gen Alpha are now about 14 years old and include the children of millennials.
While Dretsch agreed with McCrindle's definition, Sheehan told ""GMA"" they consider Gen Alpha to be ""the kids [who] are being born at this very moment, up until about age 12,"" noting that there is ""some fluidity"" when it comes to defining the generation.
Why are we talking about Gen Alpha?
Dretsch noted it is important to discuss Gen Alpha ""for all of us to understand how we interact with one another.""
She said there has been a surge in interest on the topic recently, as companies begin trying to ""understand how these different generations of consumers approach and interact with the world so differently.""
Gen Alpha by the numbers
According to McCrindle, Gen Alpha is predicted to be the largest generation ever, amounting to more than 2 billion members once they have all been born.
Sheehan, however, shared a different point of view, citing declining birth rates in the U.S. and in other countries around the world.
""We're still counting Gen Alpha, but I think every indication shows us that this is also going to be a small generation,"" Sheehan said, adding that Gen Z as a group is ""substantially smaller"" than millennials.
Gen Alpha and their relationship with technology
Dretsch said despite being closer in age, those in Gen Alpha seem to have different views on technology than Gen Z.
When it comes to technology, Dretsch said Gen Z started using it as ""an escape,"" while Gen Alpha uses technology ""to live and enjoy their life.""
""Gen Zers will view learning, for example, and playing games, as two separate concepts,"" she said. ""Gen Alphas view it as the same thing … there's a seamless integration for them in terms of a gamified experience.""
Sheehan pointed out that the number of those in Gen Alpha who identify as gamers are ""off the charts,"" adding that ""being a gamer is completely ubiquitous with this generation"" and contributes to their ""very empowered attitude about technology.""
Gen Alpha and their bonds with family
Like millennials and their parents and grandparents before them, Gen Alpha kids -- who are primarily the children of millennials -- have a strong bond with their families, according to Dretsch.
""Millennials raise them as 'mini-me's,'"" Dretsch said. ""So, I call Gen Alphas the 'mini millennials,' and we see a close relationship in terms of how they approach life, the brands that they use, the lifestyle that they're creating for their families.""
Gen Alpha and their traits
Sheehan said some research shows kids in Gen Alpha describe themselves as ""incredibly creative"" and ""kind."" She said these behaviors are evident in their involvement in social activities in school and social campaigns in media.
""Humor is so important to this generation,"" Sheehan explained. ""While there [are], on one hand, these concerns about technology and loss of childhood, I think there's some good news too, that this focus on being kind and being creative and being funny is really a hallmark of this generation.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-10-09,"Adam Schiff, Steve Garvey argue about Trump impeachment trial during California US Senate debate",The 2020 impeachment trial against Donald Trump sparked a bitter exchange between California Senate candidates Adam Schiff and Steve Garvey at a forum on Tuesday.,"Echoes of the 2020 impeachment trial against Donald Trump sparked a bitter exchange between California Senate candidates Rep. Adam Schiff and Steve Garvey at the U.S. Senate Candidate Forum on Tuesday.
The forum, hosted by ABC station KABC and the League of Women Voters of California and co-hosted by ABC stations KGO and KFSN, as well as media partner Univision Los Angeles, was also streamed on ABC News Live as part of a series of live-streamed U.S. Senate debates.
Asked by moderator and KABC Eyewitness News anchor Marc Brown about which presidential candidate they were each supporting, Schiff – who led the impeachment trial – said he was supporting Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and then turned his ire on Trump.
""Donald Trump, I think, was a disastrous president. I think he has threatened our democracy... Americans want someone who is good and decent and ethical and knows right from wrong, who's capable of telling the truth as the president of the United States. And the choice, to me is very clear, and it's Kamala Harris,"" Schiff said.
Rep. Adam Schiff and Steve Garvey are onstage at the U.S. Senate Candidate Forum hosted by ABC station KABC and the League of Women Voters of California on Tuesday.
KABC
Garvey -- a former MLB player who has tried not to tie himself closely to Trump -- responded to the question by saying, ""You've been trying to paint me for a year now into one corner or the other, and I've said, 'I'm running a Steve Garvey campaign. I make my decisions based on what I think is best for the people.'""
MORE: Trump's return to Butler marked by heightened security and reflective supporters
While running as a Republican, Garvey did not attend the Republican National Convention in July and Trump has not endorsed Garvey.
Garvey praised Trump, who he said he voted for three times, but added that Schiff is focused on Trump to the detriment of Californian voters. ""I can't imagine how you could get up every morning and have one mission, and that's to go after Donald Trump. You were made a proxy by the higher-ups in your party… how can you think about one man every day and focus on that when you've got millions of people in California to take care of?""
""Mr. Garvey likes that particular attack because that's what Trump likes to say. It's his way of telling MAGA [Make America Great Again] viewers out there, 'Hey, I'm one of you.' That's not what Californians are looking for, Mr. Garvey,"" Schiff responded while defending his work as the impeachment manager.
MORE: Harris, pressed on how she'd get economic plan through Congress, suggests there might be a path
Schiff then brought up being present during the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, adding, ""The fact that you think that's perfectly OK, that you still want to support the guy who incited that violent attack -- that tells me that you would never take your oath of office as seriously as serious as I do.""
Garvey took a moment to respond, prompting Schiff to mock, ""I've left him speechless.""
""I'm trying to think about all of the things that you've lost. You know, when you step up and you talk like you talk right now, it tells those hard-working people in California that you don't care about them. You care about something else,"" Garvey countered.
Rep. Adam Schiff and Steve Garvey are onstage at the U.S. Senate Candidate Forum hosted by ABC station KABC and the League of Women Voters of California on Tuesday.
KABC
Garvey also criticized Schiff for being censured by the House of Representatives and from being later ""banned"" from the House Intelligence Committee as well. Both moves were spearheaded by Republicans and criticized by Schiff and Democrats as partisan politicking.
Both candidates are vying for the California U.S. Senate seat long held by the late Dianne Feinstein, who passed away in September 2023.
Schiff is a longtime member of the U.S. House of Representatives and was first elected to the House in 2000. Steve Garvey, a 10-time MLB All-Star, is a former Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres first baseman. More recently, he worked as a businessman and motivational speaker.
Analysts have not seen the race as too competitive, as opposed to the top-two primary, which was hotly contested.
In the deep blue state, Schiff currently has an over 30-point lead over Garvey in 538's current polling average for the Senate race, and his fundraising also dwarfs Garvey's by the tens of millions, according to an analysis by OpenSecrets.
But the race is one of 34 U.S. Senate seats up for election in 2024, as Democrats hope to hold the Senate and retake control of the House of Representatives, and as Republicans hope to flip the upper chamber.

Most of the debate focused on issues relevant to Californians, although some of them rank as issues that Americans nationally are focused on during the current election cycle.
On immigration and border security, both Schiff and Garvey support stronger border security, although they framed their views largely along their party lines.
Schiff called for both strong border measures and a humane policy, ""We need to get control [of] the border. We need a strong border policy, which is going to require us, first and foremost, have more personnel along the border,"" he said, adding that better technology is needed to interdict people and narcotics. ""But we also need a comprehensive immigration policy, that treats those that are trying to immigrate or migrate as human beings, that's consistent with our values,"" he said.
Garvey, afterward, voiced support for having a secure border and tied Schiff to what he framed as the current presidential administration's failure to do so.

""Let's face it, the times that I've been at the border when I've gone up and down, it's an existential crisis in this country that's been created by Joe Biden and with this man right here,"" Garvey said, saying that he would support reinforcing Border Patrol, reinstating the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy that required asylum seekers to not cross, and finishing the border wall.
On the economy and cost of living, Garvey said, ""I think under Mr. Schiff's watch, over these last 25 years, you've seen this come to a situation now where we're much worse off than we were four years ago."" He said he supports free markets and less restrictions on energy.
Schiff said he supports a low-income housing tax credit to incentivize building new housing units, as a way to alleviate the burden of the cost of housing, adding, ""We also have to get local communities to approve housing much more quickly.""
On trade, Garvey said later that he supports some tariffs on companies that threaten the success of American companies, but overall does not think tariffs are the answer to helping the economy, including less taxation on American companies ""so that we can get all these products and services in this country without the need for importing from other countries.""
Schiff said that he does not support ""across the board tariffs"" like the ones supported by Donald Trump, but that he supports ""targeted tariffs when China is dumping steel or dumping other products or dumping technology to try to drive American businesses out of business.""

Garvey also used the economy as a way to get in another dig at Schiff.
""As Mr. Schiff mentioned, about the economy and about getting the economy back -- well, I like to call that 'Schiff-flation', when he talks about the economy, and trying to get that to coincide, to kind of line with new innovations, like AI,"" Garvey said at another point in response to a question on artificial intelligence.

2024-10-09,Shop It Like It’s Hot: Prime Big Deal Days,Lifestyle and beauty expert Milly Almodovar drops by to share the hottest product deals for October’s Prime Big Deal Days.,"Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.
The Albertsons logo is displayed at an Albertsons supermarket on August 26, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,Study: 'Angry bettors' behind growing abuse of NCAA athletes,요약 없음,"Abuse by ""angry sports bettors"" is one of the most common types of harassment college athletes receive, making up at least 12% of publicly posted social media abuse, according to a new analysis conducted on behalf of the NCAA.
The NCAA partnered with data science company Signify Group, which analyzed social media accounts for more than 3,000 college athletes, approximately 500 coaches, 200 event officials and 165 teams during the 2024 College Football Playoff, men's and women's basketball tournaments, men's and women's College World Series and volleyball and gymnastics championships.
The NCAA, which will publish the full findings Thursday, released an excerpt on sports betting to ESPN on Tuesday.
The study defined ""angry sports bettors"" as individuals who ""engage in problematic and intrusive communications due to match events and results contradicting bettors' predictions."" Athletes received abusive messages before, after and during events. The survey listed sexual abuse, racism and homophobia as among other common harassment categories. Signify analysts found some abusive posts that did not overtly mention gambling still had ties to betting.
The analysis flagged 743 abusive or threatening messages referencing betting or match-fixing allegations, with 73% of them occurring during March Madness, the most popular event with American bettors. Women athletes received approximately 59% more abusive messages than men, the analysis found.
The issue occurred even in sports that are less popular with gamblers, including softball, where 24% of abusive messages flagged were from angry bettors.
The NCAA emphasized that the analysis covered only public-facing threats, not private messages, where, according to Signify executives, harassment is likely worse.
Signify's research on social media harassment in global sports found that angry sports bettors drive as much as 45% of all abuse surrounding some major sports tournaments.
The NCAA shared a handful of examples of abusive messages sent during March Madness, including one directed at a high-profile men's basketball player before a tournament game that read, ""Yo no big deal but if you don't get 22 points and 12 boards everyone you know and love will Be dead."" Other examples included requests for money.
""It's clear to us too ... as the prevalence of sports betting went up, so did the prevalence of sports betting-related abuse,"" Clint Hangebrauck, the NCAA's managing director of enterprise risk, told ESPN.
Eighteen of the 38 states that offer legal sports betting, as well as the District of Columbia, prohibit licensed sportsbooks from offering college prop bets, a ban the NCAA supports. Gambling regulators in states with such bans have reported fewer issues of harassment, according to Hangebrauck.
""I don't want to draw too many conclusions from that,"" he said, ""but it does seem like it's having a positive effect.""
Signify used artificial intelligence to flag potentially abusive social media posts that tagged athletes, coaches, teams and officials on X, Instagram, TikTok and Facebook. The company's data scientists reviewed the posts and flagged those that met the criteria for harassment or abuse. Some were deemed serious enough to be referred to authorities, the company said.",, traveling and for everyday comfort. Choose from 13 styles. Shipping is $4.99 or free with three pairs.,,,,,,,,,,

2024-10-03,Trump and Harris both want a manufacturing boom. They have very different plans for doing it.,Manufacturing accounts for about 10% of U.S. gross domestic product.,"In the final weeks of the campaign, former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have sought to best each other on the all-important issue of the economy, which many voters rank as their top concern.
Both candidates have made manufacturing a centerpiece of their plans, but their respective approaches feature stark differences.
Harris aims to close corporate tax loopholes and throw government support behind the production of critical goods. By contrast, Trump wants to protect domestic manufacturers with tariffs on foreign products while cutting corporate taxes and easing regulations.
Manufacturing accounts for about 10% of U.S. gross domestic product and an even smaller share of the nation's jobs. But the sector bears outsized importance since the production of essential goods holds national security implications and many manufacturing workers live in key swing states, experts said.
""There's a belief that manufacturing is special,"" Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who studies trade policy, told ABC News.
MORE: Trump says he could impose tariffs without approval from Congress. Is he right?
Here's what to know about where Harris and Trump stand on manufacturing, and what experts think of their respective plans:
Trump: Tariffs and corporate tax cuts
On the campaign trail, Trump talks about tariffs more than just about any other policy proposal. The tax on imports makes up a key part of his plan for revitalizing manufacturing, alongside a lower tax burden for companies that he says would boost production and hiring.
Trump has promised a sharp escalation of tariffs enacted during his first term. Trump has proposed tariffs of between 60% and 100% on Chinese goods. A set of far-reaching tariffs would also include a tax as high as 20% on all imported products.
In theory, a tax on imports would give domestic producers a leg up in competition with foreign manufacturers, Christopher Conlon, a professor of economics at New York University who studies trade, told ABC News.
""His plan is based on the idea that foreign competitors are pricing their products too low and what we need to do is erect a wall of tariff barriers around the U.S.,"" Conlon told ABC News.
An escalation of tariffs could expand certain areas of U.S. manufacturing vulnerable to foreign competition, which could result in added jobs at companies protected by the policy, experts said.
The economy added manufacturing over the first few years of his presidency, though the pandemic wiped out much of those gains.
Experts cautioned about a spike in input costs and consumer prices that could end up hindering many manufacturers and hammering household budgets. Evidence indicates that the Trump tax cut did not provide a significant boost for the economy, they added.
U.S. manufacturers of sophisticated products like automobiles and advanced medical equipment often import raw materials. A tariff would likely raise costs for those companies and risk making them less competitive on the global market, Conlon said. While adding jobs at some manufacturers, the policy could cause layoffs at others.
""Nobody seems to have shared that wisdom with the Trump campaign,"" Conlon said.
A similar cause and effect applies to prices paid by everyday people for imported goods at the grocery or department store. Broad tariffs on foreign goods would likely force importing companies to raise prices and reignite inflation, experts said.
In a statement to ABC News, the Trump campaign said its manufacturing plan would create jobs and cut taxes.
""President Trump is a businessman who built the greatest economy in American history, and certainly doesn't need economics lessons from a professor who has never created jobs or built anything in his life,"" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.
""President Trump successfully imposed tariffs on China in his first term AND cut taxes for hardworking Americans here at home -- and he will do it again in his second term. President Trump's plan will result in millions of jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars returning home from China to America,"" the statement added in part.

Harris: Close tax loopholes and provide government support
Harris has proposed a different approach to manufacturing that emphasizes closing tax loopholes for some large corporations and providing government support for high-priority areas within the sector.
The agenda carries over a key part of the strategy undertaken by the Biden administration, which invested billions into manufacturing through a series of measures focused on bolstering key industries.
The Inflation Reduction Act spent hundreds of millions of dollars to boost U.S. production of renewables as the nation pursues ambitious carbon emissions goals and a supply chain less dependent on China. While the CHIPS and Sciences Act infused tens of billions into the production of semiconductors.
""The Biden administration has picked sectors, and in those sectors companies are eligible for assistance,"" said Lovely.
Last week, Harris put forward a plan calling for $100 billion investment in manufacturing to further bolster the sector. The policy would prioritize ""industries of the future,"" such as carbon-efficient steel production and data centers for artificial intelligence, the campaign said in a statement last week.

The Harris campaign said it aims to pay for the investment with a reform of the international tax code that prevents producers from skirting U.S. taxes in a ""race to the bottom.""
""The facts are clear: When he was president, Trump lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs and created new incentives for companies to ship American jobs to China. Economists warn if Trump takes power again, his policies will crush American manufacturing jobs, send even more jobs to China, and cost middle class families $4,000 a year. This is a fundamental contrast with Vice President Harris, who is leading an American manufacturing boom – creating jobs right here at home and outcompeting China,"" Harris campaign spokesperson Joseph Costello said in a statement to ABC News.
It remains unclear whether the support for manufacturing provided by the Biden administration has yielded significant gains in output or jobs, experts said.
The measures, however, have elicited a burst of factory construction. Spending on manufacturing-related construction surged from $76.4 billion in January 2021 to $238.2 billion in August 2024, U.S. Census Bureau data showed.
The surge in construction marks a positive signal but the critical test will be whether the plants deliver strong output and well-paying, long-term jobs, said Conlon.
""We haven't had enough time to see if there's a real effect or not,"" he added. ""How many chips are getting built by these plants? We don't know that yet.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-10-02,Microsoft unveils refreshed ‘Copilot’ AI companion,Microsoft’s newest update gives a conversational voice to its artificial intelligence companion “Copilot” and the company says it is built to be emotionally intelligent.,"Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,"Embattled MLB legend Pete Rose, all-time hits leader, dies at 83",요약 없음,"NEW YORK -- Pete Rose, baseball's career hits leader and fallen idol who undermined his historic achievements and Hall of Fame dreams by gambling on the game he loved and once embodied, has died. He was 83.
Stephanie Wheatley, a spokesperson for Clark County in Nevada, confirmed on behalf of the medical examiner that Rose died Monday. Rose was found by a family member. The coroner will investigate to determine the cause and manner of death, but there are no signs of foul play, according to ABC News. Over the weekend, Rose had appeared at an autograph show in Nashville with former teammates Tony Perez, George Foster and Dave Concepcion.
For fans who came of age in the 1960s and 1970s, no player was more exciting than the Cincinnati Reds' No. 14, ""Charlie Hustle,"" the brash superstar with the shaggy hair, puggish nose and muscular forearms. At the dawn of artificial surfaces, divisional play and free agency, Rose was old school, a conscious throwback to baseball's early days. Millions could never forget him crouched and scowling at the plate, running full speed to first even after drawing a walk or sprinting for the next base and diving headfirst into the bag.
Major League Baseball, which banished him in 1989, issued a brief statement expressing condolences and noting his ""greatness, grit and determination on the field of play."" Reds principal owner and managing partner Bob Castellini said in a statement that Rose was ""one of the fiercest competitors the game has ever seen"" and added: ""We must never forget what he accomplished.""
A 17-time All-Star, the switch-hitting Rose played on three World Series winners. He was the National League MVP in 1973 and World Series MVP two years later. He holds the major league record for games played (3,562) and plate appearances (15,890) and the NL record for the longest hitting streak (44). He was the leadoff man for one of baseball's most formidable lineups with the Reds' championship teams of 1975 and 1976, with teammates that included Hall of Famers Johnny Bench, Tony Perez and Joe Morgan.
""My heart is sad,"" Bench said in a statement. ""I loved you Peter Edward. You made all of us better. No matter the life we led. No one can replace you.""
In a post on social media Monday night, the Reds said they are ""heartbroken"" to learn of Rose's death.
  But no milestone approached his 4,256 hits, breaking his hero Ty Cobb's 4,191 and signifying his excellence no matter the notoriety which followed. It was a total so extraordinary that you could average 200 hits for 20 years and still come up short. Rose's secret was consistency and longevity. Over 24 seasons, all but six played entirely with the Reds, Rose had 200 hits or more 10 times, and more than 180 four other times. He batted .303 overall, even while switching from second base to outfield to third to first, and he led the league in hits seven times.
""Every summer, three things are going to happen,"" Rose liked to say. ""The grass is going to get green, the weather is going to get hot and Pete Rose is going to get 200 hits and bat .300.""
Rose reached 1,000 hits in 1968, 2,000 just five years later and 3,000 just five years after that. He moved into second place, ahead of Hank Aaron, with hit No. 3,772, in 1982. No. 4,000 was off the Phillies' Jerry Koosman in 1984, exactly 21 years to the day after his first hit. He caught up with Cobb on Sept. 8, 1985 and surpassed him three days later, in Cincinnati, with Rose's mother and teenage son, Pete Jr., among those in attendance.
Rose was 44 and the team's player-manager. Batting left-handed against the San Diego Padres' Eric Show in the first inning, he smacked a 2-1 slider into left field, a clean single. The crowd of 47,000-plus stood and yelled. The game was halted to celebrate. Rose was given the ball and the first-base bag, then wept openly on the shoulder of first base coach and former teammate, Tommy Helms. He told Pete Jr., who would later play briefly for the Reds: ""I love you, and I hope you pass me.""
He thought of his late father, a star athlete himself who had pushed him to play sports since childhood. And he thought of Cobb, the dead-ball era slasher whom Rose so emulated that he named another son Tyler.
Baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth, watching from New York, declared that Rose had ""reserved a prominent spot in Cooperstown."" After the game, a 2-0 win for the Reds in which Rose scored both runs, he received a phone call from President Ronald Reagan.
""Your reputation and legacy are secure,"" Reagan told him. ""It will be a long time before anyone is standing in the spot where you're standing now.""
Four years later, he was gone.
On March 20, 1989, Ueberroth (who would soon be succeeded by A. Bartlett Giamatti) announced that his office was conducting a ""full inquiry into serious allegations"" about Rose. Reports emerged that he had been relying on a network of bookies, friends and others in the gambling world to place bets on baseball games, including some with the Reds.
Rose denied any wrongdoing, but the investigation found that the ""accumulated testimony of witnesses, together with the documentary evidence and telephone records reveal extensive betting activity by Pete Rose in connection with professional baseball and, in particular, Cincinnati Reds games, during the 1985, 1986, and 1987 baseball seasons.""
Betting on baseball had been a primal sin since 1920, when several members of the Chicago White Sox were expelled for throwing the 1919 World Series -- to the Cincinnati Reds. In the decades following, Dodgers manager Leo Durocher and Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLain were among those suspended for gambling, and Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle were reprimanded for associating with casinos, even though both had retired years earlier.
In August 1989, at a New York news conference, Giamatti spoke some of the saddest words in baseball history: ""One of the game's greatest players has engaged in a variety of acts which have stained the game, and he must now live with the consequences of those acts."" Giamatti announced that Rose had agreed to a lifetime ban from baseball, a decision that in 1991 the Hall of Fame would rule left him ineligible for induction. Rose attempted to downplay the news, insisting that he had never bet on baseball and that he would eventually be reinstated.
Rose's story eventually changed with him admitting in a 2004 autobiography that he bet on baseball, including Reds games, though said he never bet against his team.
""I don't think betting is morally wrong. I don't even think betting on baseball is morally wrong,"" Rose wrote in ""Play Hungry,"" a memoir released in 2019. ""There are legal ways, and there are illegal ways, and betting on baseball the way I did was against the rules of baseball.""
Despite owning up to the betting, Rose was never admitted into the Hall in his lifetime, although he did receive 41 votes in 1992 (when 323 votes were needed), around the time the Hall formally ruled that those banned from the game could never be elected. His status remains a matter of debate to this day, with former President Donald Trump calling for Rose's posthumous induction.
""The GREAT Pete Rose just died,"" Trump posted on social media Monday night. ""He was one of the most magnificent baseball players ever to play the game. He paid the price! Major League Baseball should have allowed him into the Hall of Fame many years ago. Do it now, before his funeral! DJT"" 
Shortly after the ban went into effect, Rose was convicted of tax evasion and spent a number of months in prison. Also, in 2017, an unidentified woman alleged in a court document that Rose had a sexual relationship with her for several years in the 1970s, beginning before she turned 16. Rose acknowledged he had a sexual relationship with the woman but said he believed that it started when she was 16 -- which is the legal age of consent in Ohio.
Rose was a Cincinnati native from a working-class neighborhood whose father, Harry Francis Rose, like the father of Mantle, taught his son to be a switch-hitter. Rose mastered his skills with a broom handle and a rubber ball, thrown to him by his younger brother, Dave.
Pete Rose graduated from high school in June 1960. He flew to Rochester, New York, two days later, and then rode a bus some 45 miles to Geneva, home of the Reds' level D minor league team. By 1962, he had been promoted to level A, in Macon, Georgia. He batted .330 and vowed to displace Reds second baseman Don Blasingame in 1963, telling a reporter, ""I'm going to be on his heels.""
Blasingame was with the Washington Senators by midseason and Rose was a phenomenon: ""Charlie Hustle,"" Yankees pitcher Whitey Ford reportedly called him, mockingly, after watching him hurry to first upon drawing a walk in spring training. Rose hit .273 as a rookie and, starting in 1965, batted .300 or higher 14 out of 15 seasons. He was so dependable that in 1968, the ""Year of the Pitcher,"" he led the league with a .335 average, one of three batting titles.
In his post-baseball life, he did make it to a few honorary associations. The Reds voted him into the team's Hall of Fame in 2016, the year before a bronze sculpture of Rose's iconic slide was unveiled outside of Cincinnati's Great American Ball Park.
Rose's career is well-represented in Cooperstown. Items at the Baseball Hall of Fame include his helmet from his MVP 1973 season; the bat he used in 1978 when his hitting streak reached 44 games; and the cleats he wore, in 1985, on the day he became the game's hits leader.

날짜 없음,Panthers LB Shaq Thompson has season-ending Achilles injury,요약 없음,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Carolina Panthers linebacker Shaq Thompson has suffered a season-ending injury for the second straight year.
Thompson tore his Achilles during the fourth quarter of Sunday's 34-24 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals at Bank of America Stadium. 
The 25th pick of the 2015 draft out of the University of Washington suffered a season-ending broken fibula last year during a Week 2 loss to the New Orleans Saints.
Thompson indicated on his Instagram Story that he has no plans to retire. Thompson wrote, ""Yall think ima retire!! Ahah yeah right! I'll [be] back!""
The Panthers also will be without linebacker  Josey Jewell, who plays inside next to Thompson in the 3-4 scheme, for at least a couple of weeks with a hamstring/groin injury suffered in the fourth quarter.
But Thompson's injury, because of the severity of it and what he has meant to the team for a long time, hit the hardest.
""Just sick for Shaq,'' coach Dave Canales said. ""A guy that really cares so much, plays with so much passion, a vocal leader, somebody's who's had my back throughout this process. [He's one of those] people that I can ask to lead a charge for this thing that we're looking to get more of.
""So, a guy that stood for all those things, Panthers football all the way through and through.''
Thompson was able to walk off the field under his own power Sunday but later was carted off to the locker room with a towel over his head and his head bowed.
Thompson, 30, is in his 10th season. He and long-snapper  JJ Jansen are the only remaining players from the 2015 team that had an NFL-best 15-1 regular-season record and made it to the Super Bowl.
He has endured a stretch with only one winning season since then, though. The Panthers appear headed for a seventh straight losing season with the team 1-3 heading into Sunday's game against the Chicago Bears.
Thompson was having one of his best seasons, leading the team with 35 tackles. Canales said rookie  Trevin Wallace and third-year player  Chandler Wooten are first up to replace Thompson and Jewell.
Thompson was one of four players voted team captain by the players for this season. The others were defensive lineman Derrick Brown, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in the opener, benched quarterback Bryce Young and safety  Sam Franklin Jr., who began the season on injured reserve with a broken foot.
It is not immediately known if the artificial turf at Bank of America Stadium impacted Thompson's injury. But it was a noncontact injury, and no player has been more of an advocate for owner David Tepper to go back to natural grass.
Thompson was particularly outspoken in 2022 for the switch after the turf was replaced by grass for an exhibition soccer match.
""It's probably going to take all of us to stop going to practice until we get grass,"" Thompson said at the time. ""I mean they make enough money off of us to maintain grass. I hate to say this, but with our last owner [Jerry Richardson] we had grass. ... Listen to your players. We want to play on grass.""
Canales declined to speculate on whether Thompson's injury was turf related.
""I'm not an expert on turf, so I've got to leave it up to them,'' he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-09-28,Expert highlights danger of tech companies' power over society,ABC News sat down with Marietje Schaake to discuss Big Tech's influence on politics and government's responsibility in keeping these companies from harming society.,"Marietje Schaake is a Dutch politician who served as Member of the European Parliament from the Netherlands between 2009 and 2019. She's also the international policy director at Stanford's Cyber Policy Center.
ABC News’ Trevor Ault sat down with Schaake to talk about her new book ""The Tech Coup: How to Save Democracy from Silicon Valley."" She discusses Big Tech's influence on politics and government's responsibility in keeping these companies from harming society.
ABC NEWS: Some experts claim we're currently living in a tech takeover with social media, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency all increasingly prevalent. How does tech impact our daily lives and, furthermore, our democracy?
The former member of the European Parliament and international policy director at the Cyber Policy Center, Marietje Schaake, is out with a new book. It's called ""The Tech Coup: How to Save Democracy from Silicon Valley."" Marietje, thanks so much for being here today.
SCHAAKE: Great to be here.
ABC NEWS: So I think everyone is aware about tech in their daily lives or how it might impact the information that they learn. OK, I get my news from Facebook or YouTube. Democracy is this big, grand thing. So how exactly does Big Tech directly influence democracy at large?
SCHAAKE: Right. So you mentioned social media, but there's also more invisible places in our societies, in our world, where tech companies play an increasingly powerful role in building infrastructure, securing infrastructure, taking key decisions about war and peace, about election outcomes, about whether we can trust information or not, whether people get discriminated against or not.
So they are, there are really companies sitting at critical points in our society, and that is beginning to hurt democracy because the democratically elected and accountable leaders are no longer calling the shots.

ABC NEWS: And one thing that you make a large note of is the fact that a lot of these decisions made by big tech companies have been made with not a lot of regulation behind them, that they've kind of been unchecked. And those decisions then have a massive impact. I mean, how big of a role is that lack of regulation?
SCHAAKE: It's a, it's a big role because these companies are basically taking the space that they've been given. Leaders from the Democratic Party and the Republican Party in the United States have trusted that just leaving these companies to their own devices would lead to the best results. And we now see that that's not true. That there are real harms for real people, and we need to stop that.
ABC NEWS: I know that beyond just your background in government serving in the European Parliament, you talk to a lot of different people for the book, human rights activists, people that work in Silicon Valley, policy makers as well. What were some of those big takeaways or anything that surprised you from these conversations?
SCHAAKE: Well, just where in many, many different places this plays a role. We see parents that are very worried about their kids spending too much time online and not knowing what's really happening there. But it also plays a role in questions of human rights defense, you know activists around the world that are trying to fight the powers that be, but that are subject to being hacked, for example, with commercial spyware, their phones being taken over, their pictures being taken out, their context being read.
And so it's close to home, far away from home, but systematically a problem for human rights, democracy when it comes to the growing role that tech companies now play, who are, of course, in it for the profits. We shouldn't be surprised about that. But society needs something different. The public interest needs careful balancing between different interests. And we just see that those interests -- between what Silicon Valley needs and what we as people need -- are clashing.

ABC NEWS: How do we keep that in check?
SCHAAKE: Well, there's elections in this country in November, so hopefully there will be room for a more ambitious policy agenda when it comes to reining in the outsize power of tech companies. But it's also about investments and about governments that are huge purchasers of software.
Using that as leverage toward greater transparency, greater cybersecurity, more public values that can be baked into the contracts that they already have for hundreds of millions of dollars.
ABC NEWS: What about on a small scale, individual level, the parents that are concerned about their children? Is there anything that they can do on a daily basis to maybe keep Big Tech at an arm's length or at least to regulate it in their own lives?
SCHAAKE: Sure, they can remove the mobile phones from the hands of their children or create more settings that are privacy friendly and that really allow for the choices that you can make to refrain from all the data being scooped up, for example, or prevent the targeting of very young children with ads. That's something that people have in their own hands.
But ultimately, us as individual internet users are just not powerful enough to stand up to these multibillion-dollar companies. We need larger scale interventions through policy, different investments and different kind of procurement by the government.
ABC NEWS: Right. Those large scale changes in the interim invoke the democracy of your own house with your own children . . .
SCHAAKE: That's right.
ABC NEWS: . . . in deciding to make those changes. The book is called ""The Tech Coup: How to Save Democracy from Silicon Valley."" Marietje Schaake, thank you so much for being here.
SCHAAKE: You're welcome.

The post, most often shared on Instagram stories, features black-and-white text warning of ""legal consequences"" and the use of artificial intelligence by Meta, the parent company of Instagram, Threads and Facebook.
""If you do not post at least once it will be assumed you are okay with them using your information and photos,"" the text reads, in part. ""I do not give Meta or anyone else permission to use any of my personal data, profile information or photos.""
Since early September, the message has been shared widely, even though it is a hoax.
People are sharing to their Instagram stories text that says ""Goodbye Meta AI.""
As seen on Instagram
More recently, when the message is shared on Instagram stories, it is blocked out by a warning that the message contains ""false information.""
The warning directs users to a fact-check on the website LeadStories.com.
""Does posting a statement ensure that users of Meta services will not have their data used in Meta's artificial intelligence training? No, that's not true: Posting the viral statement, or any other statement, doesn't mean that Meta will not use that data for AI training, but users in Europe can object via a form in their account settings,"" the fact-check reads.

2024-09-24,Russia and Iran using AI to influence US election: DNI,"They can ""quickly and convincingly tailor synthetic content,"" an official said.","Russia and Iran are using artificial intelligence to influence the American election, U.S. intelligence officials said on Monday.
""Foreign actors are using AI to more quickly and convincingly tailor synthetic content,"" an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said. ""The IC (intelligence community) considers AI a malign influence, accelerant, not yet a revolutionary influence tool.""
Officials saw AI being used in overseas elections, but it has now made its way to American elections, according to intelligence officials, who says there is evidence Russian manipulated Vice President Kamala Harris' speeches.

Russia ""has generated the most AI content related to the election, and has done so across all four mediums, text, images, audio and video,"" an ODNI official said.
""These items include AI generated content of and about prominent U.S. figures whose content is also consistent with Russia's broader efforts to boost the former president's candidacy and denigrate the Vice President and the Democratic Party, including through conspiratorial narratives,"" according to an ODNI official.

""Russia is a much more sophisticated actor in the influence space in general, and they have a better understanding of how U.S. elections work and what states to target,"" an ODNI official said.
Iran has also used AI in its election influence efforts, including help in writing fake social media posts and news articles to further Iran's objectives, which are to denigrate the former President Donald Trump's candidacy, the official said.
Iran is also using AI to sow discord on hot-button issues, an official said.
""One of the benefits of generative AI models is to overcome various language barriers, and so Iran can use the tools to help do that, and so one of the issues that could be attractive or using foreign language for that is immigration,"" an ODNI official said. ""The reason why Iran is focused on immigration is because they perceive it to be a divisive issue in the United States, and they identify themes, and this is broadly speaking, they identify themes with which they think will create further discord in the United States.""

ABC News' Linsey Davis sat down with Johnson to discuss her childhood inspiration for entering her field, the solutions for climate change, AI's possible role in the crisis and the need to find a middle ground between apocalypse and paradise.
ABC NEWS: Envisioning a world outside of today's boundaries. That's a focus in her new book, ""What If We Get It Right?"" Ayana Elizabeth Johnson writes about the possibilities and transformations that can be achieved when it comes to our climate future. Ayana, thank you so much for joining us.
AYANA ELIZABETH JOHNSON: Thank you for having me.
ABC NEWS: All right. So you talk about growing up in Brooklyn and then a family trip that you took to Florida early on. How did that, how did both ultimately inspire you to write this book?
JOHNSON: So at 5, I learned to swim in the Florida Keys. I saw a coral reef for the first time. And like many kids who see a coral reef and learn to swim, you fall in love with the ocean. And of course, when you fall in love with something, you want to protect it.
So learning that the ocean was threatened because of pollution and the effects of tourism and coastal development and then later climate change, I thought, well, let me see if I can help, especially as the daughter of a Jamaican immigrant thinking about how important healthy coastal ecosystems are culturally and economically. This is not just a thing for tourists to enjoy; it really is the foundation of coastal economies. So that's what started it all.
ABC NEWS: I love that you have that picture from when you were a little girl on that trip.
JOHNSON: I know -- my dad, the little kiddos.
ABC NEWS: So ""What If We Get It Right?"" is the theme and question -- what are you referring to here?
JOHNSON: Climate change. We have the solutions at our fingertips, right? We could get it right. I don't know if we will. That's why the title is a question mark. But we already know how to switch to clean energy.
We know how to make our buildings more efficient, to green our infrastructure. We know how to farm in ways that make more sense and improve our food system. We know how to do transportation that's based on electricity and not fossil fuels, right? We know how to protect and restore ecosystems.
Ayana Elizabeth Johnson's book ""What If We Get It Right? Visions of Climate Futures"" is available now.
ABC News
Those are the solutions we need. It's just a matter of how quickly we're going to implement them, how quickly we can unlock the cultural changes and the political will that will let us move forward with the solutions that we have already.
ABC NEWS: You also talked to Microsoft's AI CEO [Mustafa Suleyman], and many people talk about artificial intelligence in terms of, you know, the evil robots that are going to ultimately take over our planet and also maybe cause a reduction in jobs. But do you think that AI could possibly be positive when it comes to solving climate change?
JOHNSON: Yeah. I mean, I think the issue is the AI is here, right? There's no chance of us sort of putting that cat back into the bag. So it's a matter of exactly how we could use it as part of climate solutions.
And Mustafa Suleyman, who's interviewed in this book, you'll see we have sort of a rousing debate about what we think the role should be. We have differing opinions there, but it certainly could be used to improve energy efficiency in some ways on the one hand. But on the other hand, AI is extremely energy intensive and water intensive itself, right?
So I don't think AI is needed to address the climate crisis, but since we have it, it's certainly worth thinking through how it could best be applied.
ABC NEWS: With regard to the politics of it, you write at one point: ""No matter who's in office, keep pushing, pry open windows of opportunity."" What ultimately gives you hope that humans will be able to kind of turn the tide on climate change?
JOHNSON: Well, the open secret is I'm not actually an optimist. I'm a realist. I'm a scientist, right? I know, though, that there are many different possible futures. So often this conversation is presented as apocalypse being like the option or solving climate change and paradise being the alternative. And actually, it's anything in-between.
And what I care about is that it's a huge difference whether we get to 80% of the solution or 60% or 40%. We're talking about hundreds of millions of lives hanging in the balance and quality of life for all of us.
When we're thinking about the heat waves, the wildfires, the floods, the sea level rise, the droughts, the food insecurity, the conflicts that are accelerated by all of this. The Department of Defense calls climate change a threat multiplier, right? That's what we're talking about here. So even if we don't get everything right, we should still try to get it as right as possible.
ABC NEWS: Ayana, we thank you so much for joining us. Really appreciate your insight. Want to let our viewers know ""What If We Get It Right?"" is now available wherever books are sold.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-09-21,"Three Mile Island, site of 1979 nuclear reactor accident, reopening to power AI","Three Mile Island, the Pennsylvania nuclear plant that was the site of a 1979 reactor accident, is reopening to generate power for artificial intelligence.","Three Mile Island, the shuttered Pennsylvania nuclear power plant that was the site of a 1979 reactor accident that remains the worst commercial nuclear power plant accident in U.S. history, is reopening to generate power for artificial intelligence.
Constellation Energy will restart Three Mile Island Unit 1, one of the facility's pressurized water reactors, for the launch of the Crane Clean Energy Center, which will generate nuclear energy purchased by Microsoft to power the company's AI data center, the companies announced on Friday.

Under the agreement between the two companies, Microsoft will purchase energy from the plant as part of its goal to help power its data centers with carbon-free energy.
""This agreement is a major milestone in Microsoft's efforts to help decarbonize the grid in support of our commitment to become carbon negative. Microsoft continues to collaborate with energy providers to develop carbon-free energy sources to help meet the grids' capacity and reliability needs,"" said Microsoft Vice President of Energy Bobby Hollis in a statement.

Three Mile Island, located on the Susquehanna River near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was shuttered in 2019 for economic reasons, according to Constellation Energy. Owner Exelon Corp said in 2017 that the closing was due to lack of financial rescue from the state.
On March 28, 1979, the Unit 2 reactor core at the Three Mile Island plant partially melted down when equipment malfunctions, compounded by human operator errors, caused a water pump failure that resulted in a loss of coolant to the reactor, according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

2024-09-21,Fed's rate cut sends stocks to record highs. Where are markets headed from here?,The S&P 500 and the Dow vaulted to record highs one day after the rate cut.,"Stocks rallied to record highs this week in the aftermath of a jumbo-sized interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve, presenting investors with a key question: Where is the market headed from here?
Experts who spoke to ABC News voiced cautious optimism about the outlook for the stock market, since rate cuts typically boost economic performance and buoy corporate earnings.
They warned that stocks already stand at elevated prices after a year of strong gains, leaving the market vulnerable to a downturn if the economy continues to slow.
MORE: What does the Fed interest rate cut mean for mortgages and homebuyers?
“We’re in for some volatility,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told ABC News. “It wouldn’t surprise me if the move higher is more of a grind than it is an escalator.”
On Thursday, the S&P 500 soared 1.7% and the Dow Industrial Average jumped 1.2%, catapulting both indexes to record highs one day after the Fed handed down a half-point interest rate cut.
Along with the rate cut, the central bank forecasted two quarter-point cuts over the remainder of this year and a series of cuts next year totaling one percentage point.
The banner trading session on Thursday took hold despite market fluctuations in the immediate hours following the rate cut on Wednesday afternoon, as Wall Street digested the central bank’s announcement. In early trading on Friday, markets appeared to resume that uneasy posture with a small move downward for each of the major indexes.
The topsy-turvy response owes in part to a run-up in stock prices that preceded the rate cut, experts said. Prior to the rate cut, the S&P 500 had already soared about 18% this year, in part due to anticipation of a lowering of rates.
Those priced-in expectations blunted some of the positive impact of rate cuts, experts said, while acknowledging that the move higher reflects a general preference for low rates on Wall Street.
“We finally got the rate cut that the market was expecting for months,” Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, told ABC News.
Stock market gains over the past year have relied mainly on large tech companies propelled by enthusiasm over artificial intelligence. Lower interest rates could broaden the market's upswing to companies in other sectors of the economy, giving stocks room to rise even after months of strong performance, Cox said.
“Now that the Fed is lowering rates, you would think that some momentum would shift to some of those unloved areas of the bull market,” Cox added.

However, concerns about a slowdown in the labor market -- and, by extension, a cooldown in the economy as a whole -- have cast a shadow over the outlook for stocks, experts said.
A weaker-than-expected jobs report in each of the last two months has stoked concern among some economists. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has ticked up this year from 3.7% to 4.2%.
Some observers also remain anxious about the prospects for inflation. While price increases have slowed dramatically, they’re still accelerating slightly faster than the Fed’s target of 2%.
“So long as the economy holds up and inflation doesn’t roar back to life, lower rates and strong earnings growth can continue to drive stocks higher over the long term,” Bret Kenwell, an investing analyst at eToro, said in a statement to ABC News.
Sosnick put it more bluntly. “It’s really hard to have good markets without a good economy. There are reasons to be concerned that something worse than a soft landing is on the horizon,” he said.
MORE: Will the Federal Reserve cut interest rates again this year?
Something else looms on the horizon: the presidential election in November. Experts predicted that the election would drive some financial headlines and stoke uncertainty, but they downplayed its ultimate impact on market performance.
In an examination of market performance stretching back nearly 100 years, asset management firm T. Rowe Price found that the S&P 500 performs better than average in the months preceding a presidential election, and worse than average in the months following one.
“Correlations exist in varying degrees, but clients should focus on what ultimately matters over the longer term: the economy and business fundamentals,” the firm said in its August report.
Cox underscored the point. “Chances are any changes will be insignificant for your wealth-building in the long run,” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-09-19,NASA's 'Hidden Figures' awarded Congressional Gold Medal for groundbreaking work,"The Black NASA female mathematicians and aeronautical engineers referred to as the ""Hidden Figures"" were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal this week.","A group of Black female mathematicians, aeronautical engineers and human computers whose groundbreaking work for NASA during the 20th century space race contributed to the nation's historic achievements were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal during a ceremony Wednesday on Capitol Hill.
The honorees were recognized with the nation's highest civilian honor and include three women who became known as NASA's ""Hidden Figures"" -- NASA's first black female engineer Mary Jackson and mathematicians Katherine Johnson and Dorothy Vaughan -- whose work helped pave the way for the first American astronaut to successfully orbit the Earth.
All three women were honored posthumously on Wednesday, with their families attending the ceremony to accept the awards on their behalf.
House Speaker Mike Johnson, who delivered opening remarks during the ceremony, described the women as ""giants on whose shoulders all of those astronauts actually stood at a time … when our nation was divided by color and often by gender.""

""These women dared to step into the fields where they had previously been unwelcomed. They excelled in science and math and made groundbreaking contributions in aeronautics. But these women didn't just crunch numbers and solve equations for the space program,"" Johnson said. ""They actually laid the very foundation upon which our rockets launched and our astronauts flew and our nation soared.""

""Although we call them, 'Hidden Figures,' we shouldn't think of them merely as supporting characters in the American story of space exploration,"" he continued. ""They were the engineers and mathematicians who actually wrote the story itself.""
The Congressional Gold Medal was also awarded Wednesday to aeronautical engineer Christine Darden, who is ""internationally known for her research into supersonic aircraft noise, especially sonic boom reduction,"" according to NASA, and became the first Black woman at NASA Langley to be appointed to the top management rank of Senior Executive Service.

The legacy and story of Jackson, Johnson and Vaughan was famously captured in the 2016 film ""Hidden Figures,"" which was loosely based on Margot Lee Shetterly's 2016 nonfiction book of the same name. In the film, Jackson was portrayed by Janelle Monáe, Johnson by Taraji P. Henson and Vaughan by Octavia Spencer.
NASA Administrator Bill Nelson also spoke during Wednesday's ceremony, paying tribute to the women.

According to NASA, the space race between the U.S. and the then-Soviet Union began in 1957 with the U.S.S.R.'s successful launch of the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik I.
President John F. Kennedy challenged the U.S. during an address to Congress on May 25, 1961, to send an American to the moon before the end of the decade. That goal that was met eight years later when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin became the first two humans to set foot on the moon, as fellow astronaut Mike Collins flew the Apollo 11 command module around the moon, according to NASA.
Wednesday's ceremony came nearly five years after the passage of H.R. 1396 -- the Hidden Figures Congressional Gold Medal Act -- in 2019. The legislation tasked Congress with awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Johnson, Jackson, Vaughan, Darden and ""all the women who served as computers, mathematicians, and engineers"" at NASA and NACA ""between the 1930s and the 1970s.""

One of Obama's longest-serving speechwriters, Szuplat demystifies the art of public speaking and shares life-changing lessons from his career to help anyone become a more confident and compelling communicator and leader.
Szuplat says one of the things that he's thrilled about is that he shares many of the conversations he had with Obama over the years in his latest book.
Szuplat discussed his new book and the difference between writing and delivering a powerful speech.
Former presidential speechwriter Terry Szuplat speaks to ABC News' Linsey Davis on ABC News on March 7, 2024.
ABC News
ABC NEWS: Speeches have the power to inspire, persuade and captivate. Yet crafting one, let alone standing before an audience to deliver one, is something that makes many of us sweat or even worse, panic.
In his new book, ""Say It Well: Find Your Voice, Speak Your Mind, Inspire Any Audience,"" one of the longest-serving speechwriters for former President Obama, Terry Szuplat, demystifies the art of public speaking and shares life-changing lessons from his own career to help anyone become a more confident and compelling communicator and leader.
Terry Szuplat, you've been on our show before, but glad to have you join us live in the flesh tonight. Tell us, how did you get into speechwriting?
SZUPLAT: Yeah, I think, like a lot of people, I sort of fell into it. I went to Washington thinking I was going to be a lawyer, had plans to be, you know, I was going to be Supreme Court justice arguing historic cases. And funny thing happened, I didn't get into law school, but but I got this incredible opportunity to, to be a speechwriter for our secretary of defense and just found it to help someone communicate their vision and their values to help them find their voice was something I really enjoyed.
So I've tried to sort of take what I learned and and share it with other people in this book.
ABC NEWS: Tell us about the difference between writing a powerful speech and delivering a powerful speech.
SZUPLAT: Well, I found that out in my own life. So, for for 30 years, I was writing speeches for other people and, you know, got pretty good at it. But then when I left the White House, I had to start giving speeches myself. I was being invited, and I really struggled at times. Sometimes I was fine, but other times, you know, and I write about in the book, I froze up and it was uncomfortable.
And so I had to sit down and think deeply about what was I doing for Barack Obama all those years for President Obama? What was he doing? And I just sort of relearned all these lessons, sort of reverse engineer my own career and then apply these lessons in my own life. And that's what the book is, how I learned to become a better speaker myself.
ABC NEWS: Could you give us a tip, a little sneak into say, well, as far as what transformed and what was the connection that you all made from making the words kind of leap off the page?
SZUPLAT: Well, you know, one of the things that I'm thrilled about this book is that it shares many of the conversations that I had with President Obama over the years. We were very lucky. We spent a lot of time with him in the Oval Office. And so getting his thoughts on writing and what makes for an effective public speaker. And so I asked him once what, you know, what what do you think makes for an effective public speaker? And he said, this stuck with me. Is that for him, effective public speaking begins when you know who you are, you know what you believe, and you're speaking from a place of just your core convictions.
ABC NEWS: What inspired you to write ""Say it well""?
SZUPLAT: Well, it was that experience where I finally you know, I had sort of withdrawn after a few, you know, uncomfortable public speaking situations. I was invited to give a big speech, a 40-minute speech in front of 300 people. And my first instinct, like a lot of people, I think, was to say, no, it's just too uncomfortable, too scary.
And that's when I really started to think deeply about what was it that I was doing for President Obama all those years? What were the skills that made him so successful? And the, you know, act of giving my own first real speech and it going, well, thank God it went well, said well, this is a, this can be a skill that anybody can learn. I got better at it. I tell the story of how Barack Obama, as a young man in his 20s, froze up one time.
I think most people would be shocked to hear that a young Barack Obama froze up giving a speech. But, you know, he worked to get better and all of us can work to get better. And those are the lessons that I share.
ABC NEWS: And give us a sense of a lot of people aren't necessarily giving, you know, a speech for an audience, but we are having conversations and especially in this divided time. What kind of tips might you be able to share just about effective communicating?
SZUPLAT: Effective leaders, effective speakers first think deeply about the values of the person you're speaking to. What motivates them? What's their worldview? And if you can, if you can speak to that, you have a better chance of forging a deep connection with them, maybe even persuading them.
ABC NEWS: Just before we go about 30 seconds left, a lot of people talking about artificial intelligence, the good, the bad, the ugly. What do you think with when it comes to speech writing?
SZUPLAT: I think that I have two basic rules, is this: If you have to get up as a human being and stand up in front of other human beings and you want to forge a human connection. Don't ever use a bot. Don't ever use a machine. A machine will never know what's in your heart, what motivates you. And, you know, our voice is the most powerful thing we have. Don't ever give it over to a machine.
ABC NEWS: Well, said, Terry Szuplat, but I guess we could have expected that. And I want to let our viewers know. ""Say It Well: Find Your Voice, Speak Your Mind, Inspire Any Audience"" is now available for purchase starting today. Thank you so much, Terry.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-09-19,"3D mammography better at detecting early-stage cancer with fewer false positives, study finds",The study builds on a growing body of research suggesting 3D mammography could offer benefits over 2D imaging.,"Newer three-dimensional imaging is more effective at detecting breast cancer and may improve long-term outcomes, according to a new study led by researchers at the Yale School of Medicine.
The study, which analyzed more than 272,000 breast cancer screenings over 13 years, showed that 3D mammography, known as digital breast tomosynthesis, or DBT, identified breast cancer at higher rates and earlier stages when compared to traditional 2D mammograms.
3D mammography also reduced the number of false positive results, leading to fewer unnecessary tests after initial screening, according to the study, published Tuesday in the medical journal Radiology.
The study builds on a growing body of research suggesting 3D mammography could offer benefits over 2D imaging.
According to lead co-author Dr. Liane Philpotts, this is the first study on 3D mammography of its scale, with 10 years' worth of 3D screening data.
""It confirms some of what we knew from earlier ... and shows the sustainability of these benefits,"" Philpotts told ABC News. ""But the big take-home point is that the advanced cancer rate was less [with 3D mammography]. That is the most significant finding from this.""
While 2D mammography is still accepted as a gold standard for breast cancer screening, an increasing number of health centers are incorporating this 3D technology.
Here are five questions answered about 3D mammography.
1. What is 3D mammography?
While traditional mammography involves a two-dimensional X-ray image, three-dimensional mammograms use a rotating ""X-ray arc"" that takes X-rays from multiple angles to create a detailed 3D representation of breast tissue.

This allows radiologists to scroll through 1-millimeter slices to obtain a more comprehensive view of the tissue.
2. Practically speaking, what are the benefits of 3D mammograms compared to 2D, according to the latest research?
3D mammograms may be able to detect breast cancers more frequently and at earlier stages. Earlier detection means earlier treatment and a higher chance of a cure.

In addition, 3D mammograms were associated with fewer false positive results, reducing the burden of unnecessary follow up testing. This could mean less time, money and stress for patients.
""It gives us ... a better chance of finding things, and also a reduced chance of having to call people back unnecessarily,"" Philpotts said. ""So, it's kind of a win-win from that point of view.""
3. What do current guidelines say about 2D vs. 3D mammograms?
According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines -- an influential group of experts whose guidelines help determine government insurance coverage -- 2D and 3D mammography are both effective forms of breast cancer screening.
Right now, one is not recommended over the other.
4. Is it covered by insurance?
Many insurance providers, including Medicare, cover 3D mammography.
However, coverage varies depending on insurance company and state of residence, as 3D mammograms are more expensive than 2D.

In some cases, only a portion is covered, or patients must meet a deductible first. Patients may need to call their insurance provider to understand what their individual plan covers.
5. Can I request it during my next screening?
More than likely, if you are due for breast cancer screening, you could receive a 3D mammogram.
3D breast mammography is offered at 90% of certified breast imaging centers. However, 3D imaging may not be necessary for everyone. It is a good idea to speak with your provider about whether it's right for you.

2024-09-18,What you need to know about Instagram’s new 'Teen Accounts',ABC News business reporter Alexis Christoforous and ABC News contributor Mike Muse talk about Instagram’s latest announcement and drastic new changes to the way teenagers use the platform.,"Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-09-15,Animal rights group calls for release of Argentina's last captive orca,Kshamenk – a male orca – has been living in Argentina’s largest aquarium since 1992.,"LONDON -- Animal rights activists are calling for the release of an orca who has been living in Argentina's largest aquarium for over 30 years.
The orca named Kshamenk, pronounced Shamenk, is the last captive orca in all of Latin America, living in Buenos Aires' Mundo Marino aquarium since his rescue in 1992.
Recently, viral drone footage showing Kshamenk lying almost motionless in his small concrete pool has brought renewed attention to the fate of the lone orca, with thousands around the world calling for him to be released from captivity.
""Time is not on Kshamenk's side,"" Canadian whistleblowing organization Urgent Seas, which has been leading the campaign for Kshamenk's release, told ABC News. ""The recent deaths of solitary orcas highlight the despair social animals such as Orcas feel when not living in their proper families or with members of their own species.""
""To witness their mental healths decline is gut-wrenching – as we are seeing with Kshamenk,"" Urgent Seas said in its statement.
In this screen grab from a video posted to social media, Kshamenk, an orca, is shown in his smal concrete tank at the Mundo Marino in Argentina.

In November 1992, three fishermen sailed from San Clemente del Tuyú, a town on Argentina's Atlantic coast, to embark on a normal day of sea fishing, according to Mundo Marino's biography of Kshamenk. A few hours into their trip, the fishermen spotted four black figures lying near the coast in a marshy area of Samborombón Bay, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina.
The figures turned out to be four stranded orcas that had become trapped on a muddy bank.
One of the orcas was Kshamenk – then approximately 3 years old – found by rescue teams in ""critical condition"" and ""showing various signs of weakness"" including being ""severely decompensated, dehydrated' and with ""very altered blood parameters,"" according to the biography.
The group of orcas was presumed by rescuers to have been stranded for approximately two days, becoming stuck in the sand on a mud bank after chasing a school of fish during a higher tide.
After consultation with local authorities, it was considered the ""best thing"" for the young orca to remain in the care of the Mundo Marino team following rehabilitation, according to the aquarium. The aquarium said specialists who evaluated Kshamenk's physical and mental health ""reject the possibility of transfer"" because it would ""seriously put her well-being and life at risk.""
According to testimonies of fishermen, it is believed the other three orcas were able to swim back into the sea the next day as the water level rose.
Kshamenk is estimated to be around 35 years old, Mundo Marino told ABC News. He is one of at least 54 orcas currently being kept in captivity in marine parks around the world, according to the International Marine Mammal Project.
Online petitions to free Kshamenk have garnered tens of thousands of signatures, videos posted on TikTok and Instagram shining light on the plight of the orca – which has lived for years without orca companionship - amassing hundreds of thousands of views.
Munro Marino described Kshamenk as a ""healthy, curious, active [and] affectionate Orca who enjoys playing and doing activities with her keepers."" On the orca's health, Mundo Marino said Kshamenk is in ""excellent health"".
""His survival would depend on both being accepted by a new pod of orcas and being able to hunt independently, both of which are highly unlikely,"" Mundo Marino said in a statement sent to ABC News.
""We are aware of what some activist groups believe about a hypothetical reintroduction; we respect their position, but the reality is that this is a proposal without a consistent scientific basis. It is impossible for Kshamenk to return to the sea without putting his life at serious risk.""
In this screen grab from Google Maps Street View, Mundo Marino Aquarium is shown in San Clemente del Tuyú, Argentina.

Scientific studies on orcas have found captivity can have ""harmful effects' on the marine mammals. ""The scientific data on how both wild-caught and captive-born orcas fare in captivity are increasingly robust in demonstrating that they cannot thrive under artificial circumstances in concrete tanks,"" a study by the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of New Mexico found.
""In captivity, orcas exhibit a wide range of abnormal behaviors and often die at an early age from infections and other health conditions that are uncommon in a wild setting.""
Campaigners are calling for the passing of a Kshamenk Law – known as Ley Kshamek in Spanish – a bill that calls for the ""prohibition and sanctioning of shows with while marine animals' and their exhibition or captivity without rehabilitation and reinsertion or reintegration purposes.""
""The time is now,"" Urgent Seas told ABC News.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Academy Award-winning actor, who turns 70 next week, was baptized at The First Jurisdiction Church of God in Christ Eastern New York on Saturday and received his training license to become a minister in a ceremony that was live-streamed on Facebook.
""It took a while, but I'm here,"" he said.

During the service, the ""Gladiator II"" star shared a story about Miss Ruth Green, a woman in his mother's beauty parlor who he says ""prophesied"" that he'd ""travel the world and preach to millions of people.""
""Man gives an award, God gives a reward, that's what my mother told me about the eighth or ninth time I lost an Academy Award,"" Washington began. ""Miss Ruth Green, 50 years ago, as we speak, actually. 50 years ago, I turn 70 next week. I was 20 when i sat in my mom's beauty parlor and Miss Ruth Green was known to have the gift of prophecy. Some of you may know this story.""
""She prophesied that 'boy, you are going to travel the world and preach to millions of people,'"" he continued. ""She didn't say you were going to get back in school. She didn't say you were gonna become an Academy Award. She didn't say any of those things. She said you're gonna travel the world and preach to millions of people.""
Washington then thanked God for all he's done for him and said, ""So if he could do this for me, there's nothing he can't do for you. The sky literally is the limit. And there is no limit to the sky.""
He added, ""I am thankful for all that God has given me in 70 years: A loving, faithful wife.""

2024-09-12,Oprah Winfrey discusses her experience using AI: 'We should honor it',Winfrey takes a deep dive into the technology in a new ABC primetime special.,"Oprah Winfrey is offering her take and sharing her experience on artificial intelligence ahead of her ABC Primetime special, ""AI and the Future of Us: An Oprah Winfrey Special.""
Speaking to ABC News' Rebecca Jarvis in an interview with ""Good Morning America"" which aired on Thursday, the multi-hyphenate media mogul said ""we are in for the ride of our lives"" with the technology.
""Life for all of us is about to be very different,"" she said.
Winfrey told Jarvis she has always seen herself as ""the surrogate viewer"" of the topics she explores and understands that if she is curious to understand something, she isn’t the only one.
""If I don't know the answer, I know that the other millions of people who are watching are feeling the same,"" she said, adding that her first encounter with the AI didn't happen until her first conversation with Sam Altman, the CEO of Open AI, the company behind ChatGPT.
She continued, ""And after he was telling me about all the things that I could do, I was saying, 'okay, don't be scared. Don't be scared. You can get the ChatGPT app.'""

Winfrey shared her first experience with the technology was asking for AirBnb listings for a friend.
""And it was miraculous to me that before you can practically finish the requests, the answer has come back to you,"" she said.
In the new ABC primetime special, Winfrey takes a deep dive into AI by exploring ""the profound impact of artificial intelligence on people's daily lives, demystifying the technology and empowering viewers to understand and navigate the rapidly evolving AI future,"" according to a press release.

날짜 없음,49ers' Christian McCaffrey: Was 'group decision' to sit out MNF,요약 없음,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Two days after he was a surprise inactive in Monday night's season opener, San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey explained how the decision to sit him out was made and why he was adamant Friday he would be available to play.
Speaking to Bay Area reporters before Wednesday afternoon's practice, McCaffrey attributed his confidence he'd be able to play last week to the mentality he believes is necessary in such situations.
""My mindset every week is I'm going to play,"" McCaffrey said. ""There's been weeks where I'll go the full week, not even feeling good enough to do the walk-through, and then I wake up and the body's capable of a lot of cool things. Mentally, I'm always prepared to play, and then I woke up and it was a group decision, a very tough one. I hate not playing, but I look at it as a chess move and something that hopefully you can benefit from the rest of the season.""
McCaffrey did not play against the New York Jets because of lingering calf and Achilles issues. Coach Kyle Shanahan explained Tuesday the bigger problem for McCaffrey has been Achilles tendinitis because it comes and goes at varying degrees of severity.
On Wednesday, Shanahan was asked whether there was any thought to shutting down McCaffrey and putting him on injured reserve. Shanahan quickly shot down that notion.
""No, I've never considered that,"" Shanahan said. ""We considered that he would play last week, so definitely not thinking about four weeks off.""
Because the Niners played Monday night, they will have fewer days to recover and prepare for Sunday's game against the Vikings in Minnesota. They were slated for a lighter practice Wednesday afternoon, one in which McCaffrey was again expected to be a limited participant.
McCaffrey's injury first came to light as a calf issue when Shanahan announced it Aug. 6. It wasn't until last week when teams had to release an official injury report that the Achilles part was revealed. McCaffrey was a limited participant in practice all week, and when he spoke to reporters Friday, he said he had no doubts he would play against the Jets and was even hopeful he would get his usual, heavy workload.
""I think when you don't feel right in practice there's a difference between you don't feel right, but maybe by Sunday you'll be good to go when you're working through some stuff and something's off,"" McCaffrey said. ""My mindset is I'm going to play no matter what I'm going through physically on Wednesday or Thursday practice, and then the game day you've got to make a decision.""
The calf injury was similar to the one McCaffrey had in a Week 17 win against the Washington Commanders last year, but he said Wednesday this one was not a remnant of that one.
""It doesn't have anything to do with anything last season,"" McCaffrey said. ""It's just something I'm dealing with that I'll get right.""
As for this week, McCaffrey appears to be following a similar script as last week with no certainty on his status until closer to kickoff.
Because the Vikings play on artificial surface, there has been some question about how that might factor into the decision to play McCaffrey. If he has his way, it won't be a part of the discussion, with McCaffrey saying, ""If you can go, you can go.""
Just last season, McCaffrey played on the road against the Vikings after being listed as questionable and practicing only once because of an oblique injury. He went on to post 96 scrimmage yards and a pair of touchdowns in a 22-17 loss. If McCaffrey can't go, Jordan Mason will make his second NFL start. Mason replaced McCaffrey against the Jets, rushing 28 times for 147 yards and a touchdown. McCaffrey said Wednesday he was proud of Mason for performing so well on short notice.
Still, McCaffrey was unwavering in his belief he would play, even if an official decision would again have to wait until closer to Sunday's kickoff.
""My mentality is I'm playing this week,"" McCaffrey said. ""That's where I'm at. That's how I am every week. I'm not lying. I think as soon as a player says, 'Maybe I'll play, maybe I won't,' that's not a good mentality to go into a week with when you're kind of on the fence. For me, I'm ready to go.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,Auburn's Payton Thorne says bettors asking for money after losses,요약 없음,"Auburn senior quarterback Payton Thorne on Tuesday said criticism after losses, such as Saturday's defeat to California, has included requests for money from bettors.
Thorne, appearing on "" The Next Round,"" said bettors have messaged him on Venmo, asking for money.
""They're definitely not sending cash,"" Thorne, who had four passes intercepted in the 21-14 loss to Cal on Saturday, said with a chuckle. ""It's funny. When they lose money, they want their money back. But when they win money on a parlay, no one's ever sent me any of the money.""
Thorne made light of the requests for money during his appearance, but the issue is something that the NCAA is monitoring and trying to combat.
Results from a study by Signify, an artificial intelligence company and NCAA partner, found that 1-in-3 high-profile college athletes receive messages from individuals with a ""betting interest.""
At the request of the NCAA, Maryland, Louisiana, Ohio and Vermont are among the states that have banned sportsbooks from offering prop bets on college players.
Professional athletes also have had similar experiences.
PGA golfer Max Homa said bettors tracked down his Venmo account and requested money from him multiple times per week.
""That gets old,"" Homa told The Washington Post.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-09-10,Apple announces new iPhone,The tech giant unveiled its new iPhone 16 on Monday replete with artificial intelligence-driven features.,"Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

2024-09-10,Singles are going old school: swapping apps for real-life dating,"Dating apps are becoming too overwhelming, so singles are going back to in real life dating.","Many singles currently navigating the dating landscape are voicing their dissatisfaction with using apps like Hinge, Tinder and Bumble to find their love connection.
According to Singles Report, almost 80% of singles say they experience some degree of emotional fatigue or burnout when dating online.
""What's different for dating in this moment is that the sheer volume of rejection and disappointment is so much higher for daters than it has been in previous generations,"" Myisha Battle, a relationship expert, told ""Nightline."" ""Without the success of feeling like you've met somebody that you even like and want to spend time with, let alone a relationship.""
That's why more and more people are choosing to find love in person. Singles and dating events are experiencing an increase in attendance, including the resurgence of speed-dating events, according to Eventbrite.
VIDEO: Singles return to in-person mingling after dating app burnout

Relationship experts, like Battle, say these in real-life (IRL) events speak to our craving for something that was once commonplace.
""We are really lacking in third spaces - I'm thinking about cafes, music stores, bookstores, those spaces where people used to kind of organically hang out,"" Battle said. ""So we are robbed right now of a lot of in-person opportunities.""
In the absence of those organic, in-person opportunities, some are turning to even more old-school ways of finding love.
Shows like ""Indian Matchmaking,"" and ""Jewish Matchmaking,"" are reflecting a renaissance in the ancient art of pairing couples for life.
People like Aleeza Ben Shalom, a professional shadchan/matchmaker, have helped singles find their person, as chronicled in her hit Netflix show ""Jewish Matchmaking,"" which draws from her religious and cultural roots. She says she has helped more than 200 couples get married.
""A matchmaker really has three jobs. The first job is to be an introducer and put people together,"" Shalom said. ""The second job is to be a coach, walk the walk and talk the talk and help them through the process. The third job is to be a closer. A closer is the person that says, no, you're going to get married. This is good. You got this. This is a good relationship. Or, I know you might love him, but it's never going to work. You need to break up.""
Since the show's success, Shalom has been traveling the world, hosting live matchmaking shows.
Shalom's matchmaking peers attend conferences like the Global Love Institute to learn how to perfect their craft. At the New York City conference this year, more than 100 matchmakers were eager to learn how to assist clients in finding their perfect match.
""One of the things that's different between matchmakers today and matchmakers a long time ago is that matchmakers today know the science of relationships,"" author Terri Orbuch, a relationship expert, said. ""And they know what's important to long-term, happy relationships.""
A long-term relationship is what 28-year-old Jada Harmon has been searching for in a special person over the past year. She recently switched up her dating strategy by leaning into in-person events.
""I am in a space where I feel more ready now, more than ever to make time for a long-term relationship,"" Harmon said. ""I love someone who is ambitious, has goals for themselves and hobbies.""
Harmon is currently on a break from dating apps and is prioritizing in-person connections, just meeting people by chance. As singles like Harmon continue their search for love in real life, the major dating apps are experimenting with artificial intelligence.
Earlier this year, Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd made headlines for talking about the possibility of AI's role in the matchmaking process saying ""There is a world where your dating concierge could go and date for you with other dating concierge. And then you don't have to talk to 600 people. [...] And say these are the three people you really ought to meet. That’s the power of AI.""
Meanwhile relationship experts are skeptical for now.
""No robot is going to be able to tell me who I'm attracted to,"" said Battle. ""There's absolutely no way that they're going to know whether I like that person's smell, there's no way that they're going to know if I like that person's brain, there's no way that I'm willing to that they're going to be able to predict whether or not that's going to be a lasting connection for me.""
Whether it’s working with a matchmaker, going to that speed-dating event, or giving the apps one last try, experts say there’s something to be gained in the journey, not just the destination.
""Rather than dating with this goal of like, 'I have to find a partner, I have to have a partner,' it might be better to have a goal of 'I want to have experiences with people so I understand who's a good fit for me,'"" Battle said. ""So dating can be this process of self discovery as well.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,Jordan Mason stars as San Francisco 49ers open with MNF win,요약 없음,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- For the past two-plus seasons, Jordan Mason has always looked the part of a starting running back. He just hadn't been able to play it until Monday night.
The wait might have been longer than Mason wanted and come about under less-than-ideal circumstances -- replacing an injured Christian McCaffrey -- but it was clear in the season opener that Mason was more than ready for the job, as he and the Niners battered the New York Jets on the ground in a 32-19 victory.
""I've been working all of training camp for this moment, and I'm blessed to be able to get to play today and show it,"" Mason said.
By the time Mason was done, he'd set career highs with 28 carries for 147 yards. He added a rushing score and caught a pass for 5 more yards. After the win, some were left wondering when the Niners knew McCaffrey would be out and Mason would be in.
In an on-field interview with ESPN's Lisa Salters, Mason suggested he found out ""maybe Friday night"" that he could be in line for the start. Coach Kyle Shanahan offered that no decision was made on Friday and nothing was decided until Monday.
Regardless, Mason's start came as a surprise after McCaffrey was announced as an inactive 90 minutes before Monday night's kickoff at Levi's Stadium because of lingering calf and Achilles injuries. During the week, McCaffrey participated in all four Niners practices on a limited basis and was officially listed as questionable on Saturday's final injury report.
Despite all that, the expectation for McCaffrey was that he would be ready to roll. McCaffrey said Friday afternoon he had no doubts he would play against the Jets and expressed hope he'd be in line for his usual heavy workload.
After the game, Shanahan said ""it was a little too much today"" for McCaffrey to be able to play, noting that San Francisco ""thought it was going to be smart to keep him out."" Shanahan added that McCaffrey did not have a setback in practice.
""It was on and off throughout the week,"" Shanahan said. ""He was able to practice throughout the week, just it was always bothering him to a degree. Sometimes, it goes away. Sometimes, it comes back. Today, it was bothering him a little too much where he didn't feel good about it.""
McCaffrey's injury combined with the season-ending hamstring injury to Elijah Mitchell in training camp opened the door for Mason to ascend the depth chart, an opportunity he quickly claimed with a strong camp that likely would have boosted him past Mitchell anyway.
Mason's training camp performance left the Niners confident he was ready to step in and produce despite never having had more than 11 carries, 69 yards or 27 offensive snaps in an NFL game before Monday night.
His 28 carries against the Jets were the most in a regular-season game by a Niner since Shanahan took over in 2017 and the most in a 49ers season opener in franchise history. His 147 yards were the fourth-most rushing yards in a season opener by an undrafted player all time and the second most by an undrafted player on ""Monday Night Football.""
That production was no surprise to those in the Niners locker room who have seen Mason develop from a 2022 undrafted free agent out of Georgia Tech into a player who averaged 5.6 yards per carry in his previous 33 NFL games.
""Every time he touched the ball, in my recollection, he looked like that,"" left tackle Trent Williams said. ""He looked like that tonight.
""I'm sure he's grown up over the last couple years, but it's not like I could see a glaring hole. And he matured. He came in pretty mature, and he was always ready for his opportunity. Even being third, fourth back, he was always ready. And he came in, closed a lot of games for us and ran tough -- and he earned everybody's respect.""
Many of Mason's teammates, including wide receiver Deebo Samuel Sr. and fullback Kyle Juszczyk, said they found out Monday that Mason would be starting for McCaffrey. Shanahan said he and other coaches had told Mason throughout the week that he might have a bigger role and to be ready for it, but Shanahan didn't tell Mason he was starting for sure until Monday afternoon.
""We found out he wasn't playing today,"" Shanahan said of McCaffrey, ""and we don't know how he's going to feel tomorrow or the next day. I thought he was playing this whole week until today.""
Depending on how the rest of this week goes for McCaffrey, there might be no such mystery as the Niners prepare for a trip to Minneapolis to play the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday. San Francisco's next two games are on artificial surface, which could be a deterrent to having McCaffrey return right away.
Shanahan said it's too early to make any declarations on that now, as McCaffrey will again be monitored as the week goes on.
""I'll ask the player how he's feeling,"" Shanahan said. ""If they feel good and they're ready to go, they're ready to go. If they say I feel good on grass but not on turf, that's usually a way of saying that you don't really feel that good. We'll see how he feels tomorrow. See the next day. And we'll see how he feels on Sunday.""
And if the Niners have to go back to Mason, there will be no hesitation given what he did Monday night.
""I thought he runs like he always does,"" Shanahan said. ""When you get him the ball, he breaks tackles, usually gets more than we block for. When we had the good lanes, he always hit them, and we got a bunch. But JP was awesome today.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-09-10,"Apple unveils its iPhone 16, Series 10 watch, latest AirPods","The company is releasing new versions of its iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods.","Apple is unveiling its new iPhone 16 on Monday replete with artificial intelligence-driven features as the company introduces the buzzy technology into its signature smartphone.
The Cupertino, California-based company is also releasing fresh versions of its Apple Watch and Apple AirPods.
The announcements arrive months after Apple raised the curtain on an AI-fueled operating system to be used across many of its products.
The generative AI capability, called Apple Intelligence, will allow users to summarize messages and enhance photos, among other features, the company said.
The product rollout on Monday marks the first time consumers get a look at exactly how the firm is incorporating AI into some of its top items, analysts told ABC News.
“There is still a large question mark around AI of, ‘Should I care?’” Ben Bajarin, an analyst at research firm Creative Strategies, told ABC News. “That’s the question that the industry has to address.”
For Apple, Bajarin added, the latest round of product updates are a “big deal.”
Investors, however, appeared unimpressed about an hour after the product release event began. The stock dipped roughly 1.5%.
Here are the new products released by Apple on Monday:
Apple Watch Series 10
Nearly 10 years after Apple announced the debut of its Apple Watch, the company released its Series 10 model, featuring a wider display, brighter screen and new processor.
The display screen on the Series 10 is as much as 30% larger than previous models of the Apple Watch, the company said. The larger display eases typing and reading on the product, Apple said.
Meanwhile, the screen is nearly 40% brighter than previous models. The display updates once per second in always-on mode instead of once per minute.
The updates are powered by a new chip: the S10 SiP. The improved processing enables better crash and fall detection, among other benefits, the company said.
The Series 10 Apple Watch starts at $399. It can be preordered today and will be available beginning on Sept. 20, the company said.
The company also released a new model of its high-powered Apple Watch Ultra. The Apple Watch Ultra II starts at $799. It can also be preordered today and will be available on Sept. 20.
AirPods 4
The company released AirPods 4, the latest model of its ear-bud headphones. The new product features the capacity for noise cancellation, as well as an upgraded processor and improved surround sound, the company said.
AirPods 4 allows users to nod their head ""yes"" or ""no"" in response to prompts from Siri, Apple said. Meanwhile, the product uses what Apple calls ""noise isolation"" in order to automatically remove background noise during a phone conversation.
When a user begins a conversation with someone in his or her immediate environment, AirPods 4 automatically turns down music or other media perviously playing through the ear buds, the company said.
A new H2 chip fuels the new features, Apple said.
AirPods 4 begin at $129. A version of the ear buds that includes noise cancellation will cost $179. The product is available for preorder and will go on sale on Sept. 20, the company said.
An enhanced version of the product, AirPods 4 Max, will begin at $249.
iPhone 16
The iPhone 16 will incorporate Apple Intelligence for summaries of emails and texts, aid in composing messages, enhanced camera functions and improved Siri, the company said.
The generative AI technology designed for iPhone 16 will help users draft or revise text written in third-party apps, such as Slack messages or Goodreads reviews, Apple said.
In addition, users can create novel emojis by writing a description of the desired animation.
Apple Intelligence will also improve the function of the iPhone 16 camera, allowing users to instantly learn information about the subject captured in a photo, such as a restaurant’s hours of operation or a dog’s breed, the company said.
Meanwhile, Siri will draw on Apple Intelligence to better understand prompts, even when a user stumbles on their words, the company. The new version of Siri will also respond to written prompts.
Apple Intelligence will be available in a U.S. dialect of English this year, and is expected to be released in other dialects of English next year. Months later, the company expects to release versions of Apple Intelligence in Mandarin Chinese, Spanish and other languages, the company said.
Beyond AI, the iPhone 16 will feature a wider screen display and new chip. The iPhone 16 will boast a 6.1-inch screen, while the iPhone 16 Pro will feature a 6.7-inch screen.
The new A18 chip will process up to 30% faster than the chip built into the company’s previous smartphone model.
The iPhone 16 begins at $799, while the high-powered iPhone 16 Plus begins at $899.
The price of the iPhone 16 matches the cost of last year's iPhone 15. The unchanged price aligns with a trend initiated by Apple in recent years, said Bajarin of Creative Strategies.
""This is a priority for them to keep pricing in line,"" Bajarin said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-09-07,New study finds 52 million metric tons of plastic waste produced per year,India was found to be the world’s worst polluting country.,"LONDON -- An estimated 52 million metric tons of global plastic waste emissions are produced every year, a new study by the University of Leeds has found.
The study, using artificial intelligence to model waste management in 50,702 municipalities across the world, is one of the most detailed global inventories of plastic pollution ever done, researchers said.
That amount of pollution is enough to fill New York City’s Central Park with waste as high as the Empire State Building, according to the study.
“We are just starting to get to grips with the nature and scope of the problem,” Ed Cook, research fellow at the University of Leeds who took part in the new study told ABC News. “It was a great chance to advance understanding of where it’s taking place and the sources, connecting the amount emitted to human systems and activity.”
The study found that uncollected waste was the largest source of the world’s plastic pollution, accounting for over two thirds of the planet’s plastic pollution. The study highlighted that 15% of the world’s population -- around 1.2 billion people -- are living without access to adequate waste collection service, forcing them to ""self-manage"" waste by dumping or burning it.
“This is an urgent global human health issue -- an ongoing crisis. People whose waste is not collected have no option but to dump or burn it,” said Dr. Costas Velis, the resource efficiency systems academic who led the study. “Setting the plastics on fire may seem to make them ‘disappear,’ but, in fact, the open burning of plastic waste can lead to substantial human health damage, including neurodevelopmental, reproductive and birth defects and much wider environmental pollution dispersion.”
Littering was found to be the number one emission source in the global north. In the global south, however, uncollected waste was found as the dominant source of emissions.
Southern Asia was found to have the highest plastic pollution emissions in the world with India revealed to be the world’s biggest contributor to global plastic pollution. The Asian nation produces an estimated 9.3 million tons of waste annually -- equivalent to around a fifth of the world’s total waste.
Nigeria came in second, producing 3.5 million tons a year, followed by Indonesia with 3.4 million tons.
China -- which was previously the world’s highest polluter -- was ranked fourth on the list of worst offenders. “This lower contribution to plastic emissions from China reflects our use of more up-to-date data that shows its substantial progress in adopting waste incineration and controlled landfill,” says the study.
Cook said the U.S.A. was “relatively well performing” in the study, ranking in 90th place out of the 246 nations examined in the study.
Many nations in Sub-Saharan Africa were found to have “generally low levels of plastic pollution.” However, when looked at per capita, many nations become “hotspots,” raising fears the region could become the world’s largest absolute source of plastic pollution in the “next few decades.”
Researchers are calling on policy makers to create a “new, ambitious and legally binding” ‘Plastics Treaty’ aimed at tackling the sources of plastics pollution.
“The health risks resulting from plastic pollution affect some of the world’s poorest communities who are powerless to do anything about it,” said Dr. Josh Cotton.
Earlier this year in April, progress was made towards securing a global treaty to end plastic pollution following the fourth Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-4) in Canada that saw over 2,500 delegates and 170 member states come together.
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of State said the United States is “encouraged” by progress made in the talks.
“We were encouraged by the constructive dialogue among countries during INC-4 and remain optimistic that the text of the agreement can be finalized by the end of 2024,” the spokesman said.
“We hope that our detailed local scale dataset will help decision-makers to allocate scarce resources to address plastic pollution efficiently,” Cook told ABC News.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-09-07,"AI, apps and websites have found a new home in New York","Apps and websites are thought as things that exist purely in cyberspace, but the online world is held up by a lot of physical infrastructure.","ORANGEBURG, New York -- Apps and websites are thought of as things that exist purely in cyberspace, but the online world is held up by a lot of physical infrastructure. That infrastructure is increasingly under the spotlight amid the rise of power-hungry artificial intelligence technologies like ChatGPT.
Some of that physical infrastructure comes in the form of large buildings full of computer hardware, known as data centers. Now, about 25 miles north of Manhattan, one of those crucial data centers is being erected at a construction site in Orangeburg, New York.
“So this is a purpose-built data center that’s going to have five suites in it, five data halls,” says Dan Fuentes, the Senior Vice President for Enterprise Sales at DataBank, the company behind the project.
Construction crews work to build a data center for Databank, Aug. 27, 2024, in Orangeburg, New York.
Michael Dobuski/ABC News
""Watt"" is a data center?
Databank’s Orangeburg location is the size of a warehouse. However, in the industry, data centers aren’t measured in square footage, but rather in megawatts of power.
“It’s gonna have 20 megawatts of critical power for our clients, so 30 megawatts total,” Fuentes tells ABC Audio.
Databank acts similarly to the owner of an office building. Companies as big as Apple and as small as neighborhood banks contract with the company, and those firms handle setting up and running their own computers and servers. Databank, meanwhile, is in charge of making sure those devices get constant security, cooling and power.
“So we have large clients, large hyperscalers, large banks, large enterprise clients, AI clients, who want to put their infrastructure somewhere where they’re positive it never goes down. So these data centers are purpose built to never have failure,” says Fuentes.
Uninterrupted power supply
This data center is being built next to an electrical substation, from which the center will draw power most of the time, according to Fuentes. But in the event of a power outage or a natural disaster, huge generators that line the outside of the building kick on.
Angel Otero, the operations manager for this data center, says in the event of a major power outage the generators can keep supplying power so long as they have fuel. It’s something he encountered at a different data center during Superstorm Sandy in 2012.
“All the refineries on the East Coast were underwater, damaged,” he says. “We had constant fuel shipments coming in from Philadelphia. And we had -- just, we were running on generator power for about a week. No issues, no concerns, no problems. As long as we had fuel we were up.”
Several large gas-powered generators line the outside of a data center being constructed in Orangeburg, New York.
Michael Dobuski/ABC News
A growing industry
Right now, there are more than 8,000 data centers around the world, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission, with more than 2,800 in the US.
“So, globally, there’s about 40 gigawatts of data center infrastructure installed around the world. About half of that is in the United States,” says Databank CEO Raul Martynek.
And he says business is booming.
“All that computation, as this technology has gotten more and more sophisticated, uses more compute cycles, uses more bandwidth, uses more storage. And all that drives demand for data centers,” says Martynek.
McKinsey predicts the data center industry will grow by 10% by the end of the decade. And while companies like Meta, Amazon, and Google have their own data centers, they also rent space from specially designed facilities, like the ones DataBank operates.
Cliff Stein, professor of industrial operations research and computer science at Columbia University, says all this attention on data centers shouldn’t come as a surprise.
“In the world almost everything we do is somehow tied to -- either uses them directly or uses something that’s needed on these data centers. And so, in order to keep the economy running, we need this,” says Stein.
Everything from social media companies to streaming services rely on data centers, and recently, generative artificial intelligence has hit the scene.
How AI is effecting the data center industry
“Now with the Large Language Models, it’s taken off, and it’s grown tremendously,” says Stein.
Martynek says the explosion of artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Apple Intelligence has sparked even more growth in his industry.
“It’s kind of like before ChatGPT and after ChatGPT. There’s been a tsunami of demand over the last two years, as everyone wants to adopt this technology and incorporate it into their business. I think it really caught the industry flat-footed,” says Martynek.
That’s why, he says, the sector is now in a race to build new data centers.
Data centers' environmental impact
At the Orangeburg facility, Fuentes says their clients’ computer hardware is going to live in one of five 20,000-square-foot rooms, known as “data halls.” Floors will be installed about 3 feet off the ground, leaving room for industrial strength air conditioners. Because all this computing can generate a lot of heat, the design allows cold air under rows and rows of computers.
Otero says that means the inside of a data center can get noisy.
“Depending on how much utilization the customer is using at the time, yeah, it can get pretty loud in here. Noise canceling headsets are definitely a must,” he says.
Aside from the noise, air conditioners also require a lot of power. When that’s coupled with the normal power needs a data center like this one demands, it raises some environmental questions.
“The consumption of a lot of energy, depending on where that energy is being sourced from, has an effect on the climate the same way driving more cars would,“ says Jake Bittle, a staff writer for the environmental magazine Grist who covers climate change and energy.
“If you rely on a lot of natural gas or coal power plants to sustain these data centers, that is going to have an effect on the climate because there’s more fossil fuels being burned in order to power them,” he says.
A 20,000 sq. ft. ""data hall,"" that's under construction at a data center, Aug. 27, 2024, in Orangeburg, New York.
Michael Dobuski/ABC News
The AI boom has only thrown fuel on the fire. A report from Goldman Sachs Research finds that asking ChatGPT one question takes up as much energy as ten Google Searches. Training a Large Language Model produces as much CO2 as five gas-powered cars, according to the MIT Technology Review. Bittle says as more data centers pop up to meet that demand, all that energy use could show up on consumers’ electricity bills.
“You’ll probably see some kind of strain on overall power supply. It may not have gotten there yet, but that would lead to some kind of impact for rate payers who, you know, are residential and commercial businesses,” says Bittle.
Martynek says to combat this, the industry is investing in more environmentally friendly power sources.
“We know that our electric grid is kind of outdated, it hasn’t been modernized. And we need more renewable energy connected to the grid,” he says.
But both Stein and Bittle are skeptical that the data center industry can fully rely on renewables, at least in the near term.
“It seems to me like it can make a dent, but it’s not going to -- it’s not going to solve the problem completely,"" says Stein.
“Even though the companies are doing I think, in many cases, a lot of good things to reduce the energy and water consumption of the data centers themselves, they’re just energy hogs and that has consequences,” says Bittle.
Fuentes says that AI companies account for just a tiny sliver of energy capacity Databank has sold overall.
“AI is a component of it, but it’s miniscule compared to the spectrum of verticals that we sell to.”
But the technology will be present in Orangeberg. Databank says when the location holds its grand opening later this year, 80% of the facility will be leased to Coreweave, an AI infrastructure company.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-09-06,Inside the 'crypto con' costing victims billions in losses as scam compounds spread globally: ABC News Investigates,"Crypto investment scam losses rose from $3 billion in 2022 to $4.5 billion in 2023, the FBI said.","Shai Plonski thought he had found the perfect woman. He said he had been messaging the woman named ""Sandy"" he met on a Facebook dating site, believing she shared his interest in yoga and poetry and that she lived 30 minutes away from his house in Sebastopol, California.
The two texted and shared photos for weeks until one day Plonski said he shared that his business was struggling after the COVID-19 pandemic. The woman suggested he should try investing into cryptocurrency, something she said she was an expert on, Plonski told ABC News.
""Now open your trading account ... and I will guide you step by step into the right position,"" Plonski said the woman told him via text.
At first, Plonski said he invested $200. After he was able to successfully withdraw it with a 10 % return, he continued to invest. Soon, he said he invested everything he had -- his entire life savings.
But when Plonski shared the news of his new relationship and of his success in investing with his friends, he didn't get the reaction he was expecting.
California resident Shai Plonski told ABC News he was the victim of a so-called pig butchering scam.
ABC News
Plonski said his friends showed him an article about a scam known as ""pig butchering,"" in which scammers groom their victims for months, according to the FBI, and establish a level of trust before enticing the victim into investing in a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme.
""I read the article, and it essentially described what had been going on,"" Plonski told ABC News' investigative correspondent Aaron Katersky. ""And then, you know, my heart just broke.""
Plonski attempted to withdraw his life savings but was told he needed to pay a $10,000 deposit by a customer service agent to be able to withdraw his investment. After Sandy said she couldn't help him, Plonski said he reported his loss to the FBI and cut off contact with Sandy.
According to the FBI, crypto investment scam losses rose from $3 billion in 2022 to $4.5 billion in 2023. For the first six months of 2024, the agency received over 18,000 complaints reporting crypto-investment scams, with losses of more than $1.9 billion.

""Pig butchering is one of the world's most dangerous phenomenons that is happening right now,"" said Erin West, a prosecutor for Santa Clara County, California. ""What we're seeing is victims that are coerced into a situation where they end up investing in cryptocurrency and losing all of their money.""
West, who said she has been able to recover some victims' money, told ABC News that scammers have ""playbooks.""
""They know exactly how to talk to a 30-year-old software engineer, or a 50-year-old woman with two teenage boys, or a 70-year-old man who's just lost his wife,"" West said.
ABC-owned stations found victims nationwide, including in Chicago, where a woman said she nearly lost a million dollars.
""I had nothing left, and I have to sell everything,"" Erika DeMask told ABC Chicago station WLS.
Officials told ABC News that scammers are in for the ""long haul"" and will text and sometimes even Facetime you for months or years until the individual has lost everything or realizes the investment is a scam.
""What we see people doing is we see them liquidating their 401Ks,"" said James Barnacle, a top FBI official. ""We see them going to a financial institution and borrowing money.""
""This has led to tragic situations here in the United States,"" Barnacle added. ""So not only are they losing everything, they're choosing to end their life as well. It's just a very tragic crime problem.""
Officials, including Barnacle, told ABC News the crime doesn't just involve victims in the United States.
Scam compounds
An ABC News investigation found that the people sending the text messages may also be victims themselves. In parts of Southeast Asia, Africa and South America, at least two hundred thousand people are reported to be trafficked and forced to target people like Shai, according to the United Nations.
""What is really unique about this trend is that it's double-edged,"" said Stephanie Baroud, a criminal intelligence analyst at Interpol. ""There's two different sets of victims, those who are trafficked on the one side, and those who are scammed of large sums of money on the other side. And it's true that victims on both ends of this trend have really dealt with a lot of repercussions.""
A report by the UN found that ""dormitory style bedrooms were constructed in complexes; scammer training manuals were created; enforcers were hired to control trafficking victims; and the mass recruitment of trafficking victims began."" The scam compounds are run by organized criminal groups, the UN report said.
Compounds dedicated to running cyber scams have spread across the world as these schemes net billions in illicit profit.
ABC News
ABC News spoke to Sara, a 36-year-old woman who does not want to use her real name. Sara, who lives in South Africa, claims she was trapped in a scam compound in Myanmar for nine months after applying to a customer service job based in Thailand.
Sara said she was interviewed multiple times for the job, and a round-trip plane ticket was even purchased for her to fly to Thailand by what she believed was a legitimate company.
""It seemed legit because every time I called them, they would pick up,"" Sara said.
But when Sara arrived in Thailand, she said she was driven in a car for hours and then eventually placed in a boat with gunmen.
""It was so scary, because now if this is a job, why do we have gunmen,"" Sara said.

Sara said she was taken across the border to Myanmar and placed in a scam compound where she was given scripts and several phones to message people like Shai.
""[A] lady told me, like, 'You're gonna be a scammer,'"" Sara said. ""I'm, like, 'What do you mean a scammer? Because you said I'm gonna do a customer service job, I wanna go home.'""
Sara was able to leave the compound when a fellow victim who had escaped months before helped her pay for her ransom.
Officials told ABC News the criminal groups are becoming more sophisticated and expanding to other parts of the world.
""This trend has really become a global crisis,"" Baroud said. ""And it keeps getting worse.""
Officials say awareness is key
As scam compounds grow and scammers use new tools like artificial intelligence to target individuals for money, awareness is key to fighting these schemes, said West, the Santa Clara prosecutor.
""We really need to be wary of anyone who is coming into our life that we did not invite into our life,"" West said.
""If it's well-crafted, and it reaches you at the opportune time, you might be surprised that you can really fall for the scam,"" Baroud of Interpol said. ""It's important for really any online user to be vigilant, and to really be aware of any ad they are clicking on, any very lucrative opportunity they are seeing online.""
For Plonski and Sara, sharing their stories is their way of helping people become aware of the growing scam, they said.
""People are out here trying to connect, and they don't know about it,"" Plonski said. ""So for sure I thought one way I could turn this into something positive is to try to educate and prevent it happening to other people.""

2024-09-05,"DOJ task force, formed in 2021 to fight election threats, has brought only 20 cases","Three years after the DOJ announced a task force to prosecute offenders who threaten election workers, election officials say the group hasn't effectively done its job.","On Wednesday, Attorney General Merrick Garland issued a stern warning to those who would seek to harm election officials.
""I will reiterate again today, these cases are a warning if you threaten to harm or kill an election worker or official or volunteer, the Justice Department will find you and we will hold you accountable,"" Garland said at a press event.
But more than three years after the Department of Justice announced a task force to ""promptly and vigorously prosecute"" offenders who threaten election workers, lawmakers and election officials have raised concerns about the federal government's ability to effectively prosecute cases and deter threats ahead of the November election.
MORE: Election officials continue to face threats, harassment ahead of November
Election officials and advocates have criticized the task force for what they call a lack of transparency regarding its investigations, saying there have been yearslong delays in providing accountability, and that the task force has brought far too few cases following an onslaught of threats related to the 2020 election.
Of the more than 2,000 threats referred to the FBI by election workers, the Justice Department has opened 100 investigations, according to figures released in April. In total, the task force has charged 20 people and landed 15 convictions.
The numbers are modest, in part, because many of the threats received by election workers are protected by the First Amendment. But that's done little to reassure the community of election workers and officials who have been left disillusioned by threats and harassment.
""It makes it really difficult to want to do the job when it also feels like your community, your state and your nation have turned on you,"" said Amy Cohen, executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors. ""You never know really if what you're submitting is being investigated. You never really have any understanding of why something isn't investigated.""

When reached for comment, a DOJ spokesperson highlighted the task force's work engaging with election workers through more than 100 meetings and trainings, as well as helping FBI field offices and U.S. attorneys' offices expand their capacity to investigate threats to election workers.
And ahead of the November election, Garland said ""task force representatives"" will be on the ground meeting with election workers and hosting events with the FBI to address issues and potential crimes.
But as Election Day approaches and threats to election workers persist, calls for action from the Justice Department have grown louder. In July, Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Georgia, launched an inquiry into the DOJ's work protecting election workers, and a group of senators last month wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland saying that ""more must be done to counter these persistent threats and ensure that election workers can do their jobs.""
As part of their inquiry, the group of senators asked the DOJ to tell them how many threats have been identified by the task force and the number of ongoing investigations and prosecutions. As of this week, the Justice Department had not responded to their request for more information about the task force's progress.
'Help is on the way'
The DOJ's task force was launched in 2021 as election officials faced a torrent of threats related to the 2020 election. Led by the DOJ's Public Integrity Section, the group was tasked with reviewing individual reports of threats, then partnering with United States attorney's offices and FBI field offices to investigate and prosecute those cases.
""A threat to any election official, worker, or volunteer is, at bottom, a threat to democracy,"" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco wrote in a memo to prosecutors in June 2021. ""We will promptly and vigorously prosecute offenders to protect the rights of American voters, to punish those who engage in this criminal behavior, and to send the unmistakable message that such conduct will not be tolerated.""
Election officials rejoiced, hoping the highly publicized announcement might serve as a deterrent and stem the tide of threats that was flooding their offices. At the time, 17% of local election officials reported having being threatened due to their job, while 32% reported feeling unsafe, according to a survey of election officials conducted in April 2021 by the bipartisan Brennan Center for Justice.
""When the DOJ announced a task force, we were thrilled in a lot of ways, because it was like, 'Oh, there's going to be help. Help is on the way,'"" said Cohen.
But in the three years since the announcement, election officials have continued to face heightened threats, including physical violence, fentanyl-laced letters, swatting incidents, threatening voicemails, and violent threats on social media.
According to a May 2024 survey conducted by the Brennan Center, nearly 40% of local election officials reported experiencing threats, harassment, or abuse -- a marked uptick from earlier surveys.
""The pressures that my colleagues fall under nationwide -- over things that are literally unfounded -- has become hard to deal with every day for folks who didn't sign up for that kind of pressure,"" said Dag Robinson, the county clerk in Harney County, Oregon.
'Justice is not swift'
Despite the fanfare it received in 2021, the task force got off to a sluggish start. A year after it was formed, the Justice Department had only charged four cases despite reviewing over 1,000 referrals involving hostile or harassing contact, then-Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite told a meeting of election officials in 2022. Only 5% of referrals resulted in actual investigations.
While the task force's success rate improved slightly over three years -- charging 20 individuals, achieving 15 convictions, and losing one case -- multiple election officials told ABC News that the modest number of cases compared to the thousands of threat referrals is disheartening.
""I could certainly recognize that my friends and colleagues across this country don't feel supported,"" said Julie Wise, the director of elections for King County, Washington.
In Colorado, officials say Secretary of State Jena Griswold has been the subject of thousands of abusive, harassing, and threatening communications over the last two years, including frequent messages calling for violence against her.
""You have a family, Jena,"" one user said on social media ""Think about that before you continue.""
Of the 1,140 threats referred to the Department of Justice by Griswold's office since January 2023, 13 have led to investigations, and one case has been prosecuted, according to her office.
Election officials across the country say that in some instances, charges have been announced two or three years from the time a threat was made.
""It seems as though justice moves slowly, and I have seen that some clerks who were assaulted or threatened from the 2020 election just were [only recently] able to give their victim impact statements for the sentencing of those individuals -- so justice is not swift."" said Barb Byrum, county clerk in Ingham County, Michigan.
'Legally off the hook'
In response to election officials' concerns, Justice Department officials say that charging cases requires a high burden of proof -- and many of the threats targeting election workers are protected speech under the First Amendment. To land a conviction in a threats case, prosecutors must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements are likely to be reasonably perceived as threatening -- known as ""true threats.""
""One of the biggest challenges in bringing these criminal cases is parsing what is a true threat from what is constitutionally protected speech,"" according to Jared Davidson, counsel at nonprofit Protect Democracy.
Statements that are vague, hyperbolic, or figurative can be hard to prove as threats in a criminal setting, where defense attorneys can parse out the meaning of a statement to create reasonable doubt, said Davidson.
For example, the phrase ""We're going to take you out"" could be perceived in multiple ways depending on the context of the statement, according to Eugene Volokh, a professor emeritus at UCLA School of Law.
""In context, that could mean 'kill you,' or it could mean 'throw you out of office,'"" Volokh said.
MORE: DHS warns of threats to election posed by artificial intelligence
""A 'vast majority' of the communications directed at election officials, however offensive, are protected by the First Amendment and cannot be prosecuted,"" then-Assistant Attorney General Polite said in 2022.
After prosecutors charged a Nevada man who, following the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, allegedly made multiple calls to the Nevada secretary of state's office -- including saying that they were ""all going to ... die"" and wishing they would ""all go to jail for treason"" -- a jury acquitted the defendant, illustrating the challenge of proving a true threat.
Adding to the challenge of bringing these cases is a 2023 Supreme Court decision that clarified the standard for true threats by finding that a defendant needs to have some awareness that their statement would be viewed as threatening.
""If you say something ambiguous and you don't even realize that it might be perceived as a threat, you're legally off the hook,"" said Volokh.
Cohen, who said she has been publicly raising these concerns since early 2022, told ABC News that situation has led many election officials to believe that reporting threats can be ""pointless,"" which has led many of them to no longer refer threats to the task force. A 2024 Brennan Center survey showed that 45% of threats to election workers are unreported.
""It's just hard not to feel, in some ways, like no one is taking this seriously,"" Cohen said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-09-05,Biden admin targets Russia over 2024 election disinformation efforts,The DOJ announced an indictment of two employees of Russian state TV network RT.,"Attorney General Merrick Garland announced a sweeping crackdown Wednesday on dueling efforts by the Russian government to influence the upcoming 2024 election through covert networks aimed at spreading disinformation to American voters.
For months, the Biden administration has been publicly warning of Russia's efforts to influence Americans through disinformation and propaganda to sow distrust in the election.
In a meeting Wednesday at the Justice Department, Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray highlighted both foreign and domestic incidents of attempts to influence voters, as well as pervasive and growing threats against those who administer elections.
""The Justice Department will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to exploit our country's free exchange of ideas in order to covertly further its own propaganda efforts, and our investigation into this matter remains ongoing,"" Garland said.
MORE: DOJ charges senior Hamas leaders over involvement in Americans' deaths during Oct. 7 attack on Israel
The Justice Department alleged that two employees of Russia Today, or RT -- a Russian state-controlled media outlet, implemented a nearly $10 million scheme ""to fund and direct a Tennessee-based company to publish and disseminate content deemed favorable to the Russian government.""
To carry this out, the attorney general said the two employees -- 31-year-old Kostiantyn Kalashnikov, also known as Kostya, and Elena Afanasyeva, 27 -- allegedly directed the company to contract with social media influencers to amplify Russian propaganda.
""The company never disclosed to the influencers or to their millions of followers its ties to RT and the Russian government. Instead, the defendants and the company claimed that the company was sponsored by a private investor, but that private investor was a fictitious persona,"" Garland said.
The unnamed Tennessee-based company is described in the indictment as ""U.S. Company-1.""
Sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News that the company is Tenet Media, whose website features videos from the popular right-wing and pro-Trump commentators Benny Johnson, Dave Rubin, Tim Pool, Lauren Southern and two others.
The indictment does not allege that any commentators knowingly took part in this alleged scheme, with the indictment specifically saying that two commentators were ""deceive[d].""
Tim Pool posted a lengthy statement on X about the allegations, saying that if they are true, he and others at Tenet Media ""were deceived and are victims."" In his own post, Benny Johnson said, ""We are disturbed by the allegations in today’s indictment, which make clear that myself and other influencers were victims in this alleged scheme."" When reached by phone on Wednesday, the person named as the company’s agent in the Tennessee state database -- identified as Tenet Media's owner and president in the U.S. filings -- declined to speak with ABC News about the indictment or the allegations, saying only: ""I don't have a comment on it right now. ... Right now I just have to deny you any further info about it.""
Russian entities also created fake websites to allegedly further influence the election, officials said.
""RT has used people living and working inside the U.S. to facilitate contracts with American media figures to create and disseminate Russian propaganda here. The content was pitched as legitimate independent news when, in fact, much of it was created in Russia by RT employees who work for the Russian government,"" Wray said. ""The second operation reveals even more malign activities by companies working under the direction and control of the Russian government, companies that created media websites to trick Americans into unwittingly consuming Russian propaganda.""
Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said they will continue to investigate election threats without fear or favor.
""Russia remains a predominant foreign threat to our elections, and as the intelligence community has publicly reported, and as I have previously warned, Iran also is accelerating its efforts to influence our elections, including the presidential election,"" Monaco said.
Wray also delivered a blunt message for Iran and China when asked what the bureau's response would be to those who intend to meddle in the presidential election: ""Knock it off.""
The attorney general said Russia is using new techniques Russia such as artificial intelligence and other cyber techniques.
""They're now using bot farms in a way that was not possible before, and therefore it's a bigger threat than it ever was before. I would just say that [the] reality is that Russia has meddled in our society and tried to sow discord for decades,"" Garland said.

The DOJ also announced that it's targeting a Russian disinformation campaign referred to as ""Doppelganger.""
The DOJ has seized 32 internet domains it claims have been used by the Russian government and government-sponsored actors to allegedly engage in the Doppelganger influence campaign by spreading propaganda intended to reduce international support for Ukraine, bolster support for pro-Russian policies and influence American voters, according to newly unsealed court records.
Garland on Wednesday also highlighted domestic efforts to threaten election officials around the country.
Since March, the Election Threats Task Force has participated in more than 25 engagements, trainings and tabletop exercises, including both with law enforcement partners and partners in the election community, the attorney general said.
Over the next several weeks, task force representatives will be on the ground meeting with election workers and, in early November, both in advance of and after Election Day, the FBI will host federal partners at its headquarters command center to address events, issues and potential crimes related to the elections in real time, Garland said.
""Election officials and administrators do not need to navigate this threat environment alone,"" he added.
CNN first reported news of the expected law enforcement actions.
In a statement Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken outlined the steps the State Department said it's taking to ""counter Kremlin-backed media outlets' malicious operations seeking to influence or interfere in the 2024 U.S. elections.""
The measures include introducing a new visa restriction policy to penalize adversaries, designating RT's parent company and subsidiaries as entities controlled by a foreign government, and offering cash rewards for information on the Russian intelligence-linked hacking group RaHDit under its ""Rewards for Justice"" program.
""Today's announcement highlights the lengths some foreign governments go to undermine American democratic institutions. But these foreign governments should also know that we will not tolerate foreign malign actors intentionally interfering and undermining free and fair elections,"" Blinken said.
In addition, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control said Wednesday that it's designating 10 individuals -- including several RT employees -- and two entities as part of the U.S. response to ""Moscow's malign influence efforts targeting the 2024 U.S. presidential election.""
The head of a ""hacktivist"" group RaHDit and two associates were also part of Wednesday's sanctions, the Treasury Department said in a statement.

2024-09-03,2024 fall movie preview: A look ahead at the most highly anticipated upcoming films,Film critic Peter Travers shares a look ahead at the most highly anticipated films of fall 2024.,"The pandemic is over (mostly). So are the dual writers and actors strikes from last year, both of which lasted for months and delayed the number of movies set to open this fall. The good news is that summer gave us two mammoth blockbusters in ""Inside Out 2"" and ""Deadpool & Wolverine,"" both of which grossed over $1 billion at the worldwide box office. Take that ""Barbenheimer.""
The bad news is that cinema attendance is still struggling, so the heat is on for fall movies to deliver big time. I'm expecting massive ticket sales for the sequels to ""Beetlejuice,"" ""Joker,"" ""Gladiator"" and ""Moana,"" a prequel bonanza for ""Mufasa: The Lion King"" and gravity-defying grosses for the film version of the Broadway mega-musical smash ""Wicked.""

""Beetlejuice Beetlejuice""
""The Juice is loose."" Those four immortal words should be enough to get you cheering for the horror-comedy sequel we've been waiting for since the 1988 original. Director Tim Burton is back with Michael Keaton in tow in the funniest role of his career as Betelgeuse (pronounced Beetlejuice), the lecherous, pasty-faced, motor-mouthed, rotting corpse who feeds on rats and insects and makes a hilarious art of being totally disgusting. Winona Ryder also returns as the living embodiment of goth, with newbie Jenna Ortega (""Wednesday"") perfectly cast as her daughter Astrid, who opens a shiny new portal to the afterlife. Of course she does. It's showtime.

And director Jon Watts of the Tom Holland ""Spider-Man"" trilogy thinks that two hours of basking in the Clooney/Pitt starshine can sustain two hours of screen time. He must be right.

For starters, it's a musical with songs covered by Phoenix and reliably incandescent new cast member Lady Gaga as Arthur's music therapist and love interest, Harleen ""Lee"" Quinzel, a.k.a. Harley Quinn. In shrink terms, ""Folie à Deux"" is a madness shared by two people. It can also be applied to the crazy faith of filmmakers who think what the world needs now is a song-and-dance love story between two certified lunatics. They just might be right.

Please note that ""The Apprentice"" has nothing to do with the reality competition series of the same name that Trump hosted for more than a decade. Instead, we watch ambitious Donald grow from a son intimidated by his real estate baron father, Fred Trump (Martin Donovan), to an apprentice of cutthroat lawyer Roy Cohn (a superb Jeremy Strong) who instructs his protege to ""attack, attack, attack, admit nothing, deny everything and always claim victory."" Director Ali Abbasi tracks Trump from the 1970s to the 1980s to show the key moments that helped form the once and future POTUS. The result is food for thought on both sides of the Trump divide.

Director Edward Berger, whose ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" certified him as a major talent, stages the action starring Ralph Fiennes as the cardinal trying to bring order out of chaos as two prelates, played by Stanley Tucci and John Lithgow, fight for papal dominance. With the great Isabella Rossellini as a nun struggling with men in robes making all the rules, look for an ending that really speaks to our changing times.

Working from a script he wrote with Eric Roth, ""Gump"" director Robert Zemeckis uses a form of artificial intelligence to de-age and face-swap the characters as they move from young love and marriage into their 80s. Set in the same house we watch being assembled during the colonial era, ""Here"" is the kind of claustrophobic experiment that's hard to pull off, but Zemeckis seems to thrive on films that threaten to go off the rails.

What to call director Jacques Audiard's Spanish-language telenova about Manitas, a Mexican drug boss sensationally well-played by trans actress Karla Sofía Gascón, who leaves wife (a revelatory Selena Gomez) and kids for a new love (Adriana Paz), while hiring a lawyer (Zoe Saldaña, dynamite) to dodge attention, while Manitas surgically transitions and takes the name Emilia Pérez? (Got that?) I should point out that this indelibly indescribable movie event is a musical with songs by pop star Camille. You should also know that Gascón, Gomez, Saldaña and Paz deservedly shared the best actress prize at Cannes, and that the key to enjoying this one-of-a-kind cinema dazzler is to embrace its heart and lose yourself in its glorious aura.

Denzel Washington plays a former slave hungry for control. Fred Hechinger and Joseph Quinn go freaking nuts as brothers in line for the throne.

It's a battle in song and story between Ariana Grande as the good witch Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as the green-skinned wannabe Wicked Witch of the West. All director Jon M. Chu (""Crazy Rich Asians,"" ""In the Heights"") needs to do is not screw it up. I'm still not convinced it needed to be in two parts. Who wants to wait a full year to see how it ends?

""Mufasa: The Lion King""
Here's a prequel to ""The Lion King"" directed by no less a luminary than Barry Jenkins, whose ""Moonlight"" won a best picture Oscar. These photorealistic revamps usually leave me cold -- look no further than the 2019 remake of the traditionally animated 1994 ""Lion King"" classic -- but I'm stoked to see what Jenkins can do with the tale of Mufasa, voiced by Aaron Pierre, a lion who grows up to become the future king of the Pride Lands and the father of Simba.

""The Room Next Door""
This one is already an event just for being the first full-length feature in English from Spain's legendary wild man Pedro Almodóvar. The icing on the cake is the double-barreled casting of Tilda Swinton as a war correspondent and Julianne Moore as an author who is the object of her obsession. No true film junkie will need to know more. No one invests more ferocity and feeling into women on the verge than Almodóvar.

""Babygirl""
On the surface, it's an erotic free-for-all from writer-director Halina Reijn that stars the ever-powerful and incandescent Nicole Kidman as a CEO in a failing marriage to a theater director (Antonio Banderas), who finds herself in sexual thrall to a much younger intern, played by ascendant star Harris Dickinson (""Triangle of Sadness""). Reijn, who directed the breakout hit ""Bodies Bodies Bodies,"" is still obsessed with alleged sins of the flesh, prompting Kidman to call ""Babygirl"" one her most exposing films yet. Sounds like a provocation. Who's ready?

From the trailer, you can tell that ever-fearless Timothée Chalamet is giving himself, body and soul and voice, to the role of a young Bob Dylan, leading up to the Minnesota folkie shocking such music gurus as Pete Seeger (Edward Norton) by switching from acoustic to electric guitar at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. And that was just the beginning of the times changing for the future Nobel Prize-winning poet. How does it feel to live, love and create during a momentous cultural moment? Director James Mangold, who hit all the right notes with Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash in ""Walk the Line,"" says Chalamet nails it. Can awards glory be far behind?

""The Brutalist""
Expect this big-screen epic to sneak in under the wire for the 2024 awards season the way Clint Eastwood triumphed with 2004's ""Million Dollar Baby."" Everyone loves a left-field surprise. So what if it takes indie director Brady Corbet (""Vox Lux"") nearly four hours to detail 30 years in the fictional life of László Tóth (""The Pianist"" Oscar winner Adrien Brody), a Hungarian-born Jewish architect and Holocaust survivor who sets out for America with his wife, Erzsébet (Felicity Jones), only to endure personal hell until a patron, played by Guy Pearce, offers him a life-changing architectural project. It sounds like ""The Fountainhead"" on steroids, a big risk that could pay off or go spectacularly off the rails. Isn't this the kind of artistic gamble we go to the movies for? What a way to end the cinema year by rooting for the underdog. Place your bets.

At press time, the studio was still fooling around with the release date for this biopic of opera prima donna Maria Callas (Angelina Jolie) in her final days in 1970s Paris. Still, Oscar will be eagerly waiting to see if Chilean director Pablo Larraín can pull off the biopic nominee hat trick, after Natalie Portman and Kristen Stewart scored best actress nods for Jacqueline Kennedy in 2016's ""Jackie"" and Princess Diana in 2021's ""Spencer."" I'm betting he can. And I'm betting on Jolie to catch the snarl, the flashing eyes and the tempestuous talent of Callas. It's been more than 20 years since Jolie won her first Oscar for ""Girl, Interrupted."" She's overdue for a golden bookend.

Daniel Craig kisses off the straight sexism of James Bond to play an expat in Mexico City who falls for a much younger, now-discharged Navy man (Drew Starkey), a junkie who doesn't seem that interested. Based on the semi-autobiographical 1985 novel by William S. Burroughs, known for breaking barriers with ""Naked Lunch,"" the film is directed by Luca Guadagnino (""Call Me By Your Name,"" ""Challengers""), eager to bring his own livewire modernity to what might have been a musty period piece.

2024-08-31,Landmark bill banning some dyes in food served in California schools passes,The California Legislature passed a bipartisan bill known as the California School Food Safety Act to ban six harmful chemicals in school food.,"A landmark bill to ban some dyes in food served at California public schools, aimed at protecting children's health, is headed to Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk to be signed into law after passing the state legislature on Thursday.
Assembly Bill 2316, also known as the California School Food Safety Act, would prohibit six potentially harmful food dye chemicals from being provided in the state's public schools. It was approved by the California Assembly on Thursday after passing the state Senate earlier in the week.

""California has a responsibility to protect our students from chemicals that harm children and that can interfere with their ability to learn,"" Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, who introduced the legislation back in February, said in a statement Thursday, adding, ""This bill will empower schools to better protect the health and well-being of our kids and encourage manufacturers to stop using these harmful additives.""
Gabriel was previously successful in his efforts to ban potentially harmful food and drink additives in products sold throughout the state through the passage of the California Food Safety Act last year. The legislation bans potassium bromate, propylparaben, brominated vegetable oil and Red 3 from food that is manufactured, delivered and sold in the Golden State.
Newsom signed the bill into law last October, making California the first state in the U.S. to ban the additives.
Under the newly passed California School Food Safety Act, Red Dye No. 40, Yellow Dye No. 5, Yellow Dye No. 6, Blue Dye No. 1, Blue Dye No. 2 and Green Dye No. 3 will be banned from food served to students in public schools during regular hours.

Studies suggest that consumption of the six dyes and colorants banned under A.B. 2316 may be linked to hyperactivity and other neurobehavioral problems in some children, as the California Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment outlined in a 2021 report.
While there are still thousands of chemicals allowed for use in our country's commercial food system, many of those that have been reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration have not been reevaluated for decades. Red 40, for example, was last evaluated for health risks in 1971.
Reports from the American Academy of Pediatrics align with this push to reassess the safety of artificial food coloring.
""Over the last several decades, studies have raised concerns regarding the effect of [artificial food colorings] on child behavior and their role in exacerbating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms,"" doctors write. ""Further work is needed to better understand the implications of AFC exposure and resolve the uncertainties across the scientific evidence. The available literature should be interpreted with caution because of the absence of information about the ingredients for a number of reasons, including patent protection.""
Dr. Stephanie Widmer, an ABC News medical contributor, board-certified emergency medicine physician and toxicologist, told ""Good Morning America"" previously, while discussing California's earlier harmful chemical ban, ""These chemicals are all kind of in different foods and all exert different effects and different concerns.""
""Some of them are associated with neurological problems, some are reproductive problems, some have been linked to cancer,"" Widmer said at the time.

날짜 없음,"Lions now a destination for free agents, GM Brad Holmes says",요약 없음,"ALLEN PARK, Mich. -- On the heels of their recent success, the Detroit Lions have become a destination for free agents, according to general manager Brad Holmes.
Holmes discussed the new perception of the Lions franchise Thursday, citing its back-to-back winning seasons as a reason for the overall uptick in interest from players and their agents.
""It has been different,"" Holmes said. ""In the past -- I would say for the first two years, we were doing a lot of selling and convincing constantly just to try to get guys here. ... But now, it does make you feel good that we've done something, and we've accomplished some good things that these agents want to send their players here.""
Holmes, who is entering his fourth year as GM alongside coach Dan Campbell, specifically noted that agents of wide receivers and kickers pushed to get their players in Detroit this offseason.
""Now, the wide receiver front, that was even easier conversations,"" he said. ""Every agent of a wide receiver wanted to send them here, and you know really the same thing happened with kicker too.""
The Lions ultimately did not make any high-profile additions at either wide receiver or kicker, although they did make moves at both positions. Detroit added veteran wide receivers Tim Patrick and Allen Robinson II to the practice squad Wednesday and also released Donovan Peoples-Jones before re-signing him to the practice squad.
At kicker, the Lions currently have former UFL star Jake Bates, who is in line for the regular job after Michael Badgley's season-ending injury last month.
The Lions were relatively quiet during free agency this offseason, with veteran defensive tackle DJ Reader as their highest-profile free agent signing. Detroit also traded for cornerback Carlton Davis III in a move to bolster the defense.
Holmes said he was proud that, despite the increased interest from free agents, the Lions' front office stayed disciplined in its approach and did not feel artificial pressure from a perceived championship window.
""I'm proud of us that we've avoided mentally putting ourselves into that, 'We're being in a window, and so we have to do something different,' from a roster standpoint,"" he said. ""We've kept our approach and our process very consistent in terms of how we build it, the opportunities that we provide players, and that's what give us confidence.
""We've been saying this from day one: 'We want to get better every single year.' We've done that, and we plan to continue to do that.""
Coming off their first division title since 1993 and their second-ever NFC Championship Game appearance, the Lions have the third-best chance to reach the Super Bowl this season at 17.6%, according to ESPN Analytics.
Detroit also is the favorite to win its division for the second season in a row, but it has never won 10 or more games in back-to-back seasons.
But without hesitation, Holmes expressed his expectation for the upcoming season.
""To win the Super Bowl,"" he stated firmly.",,,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,"Caroline Garcia details online abuse after US Open exit, cites 'unhealthy betting'",요약 없음,"NEW YORK -- Caroline Garcia, a US Open semifinalist in 2022, on Wednesday shared some of the derogatory online messages she has received following recent losses and pointed to ""unhealthy betting"" as one of the reasons players are targeted on social media.
Other players echoed Garcia's lament, including defending champion  Coco Gauff, who said: ""You could be having a good day, and then somebody will literally tell you, 'Oh, go kill yourself.' You're, like, 'OK, thanks.'""
Garcia, a 30-year-old from France who has been ranked as high as No. 4, was seeded 28th at Flushing Meadows but was eliminated by Renata Zarazúa 6-1, 6-4 in the first round Tuesday. Zarazúa is ranked 92nd and is making her US Open debut.
Garcia, in a lengthy post on X, wrote about the ""hundreds"" of such messages directed her way and offered examples of ""just a few,"" including one telling her she should consider suicide and another that read, ""I hope your mom dies soon.""
""And now, being 30 years old, although they still hurt, because at the end of the day, I'm just a normal girl working really hard and trying my best, I have tools and have done work to protect myself from this hate. But still, this is not OK,"" Garcia wrote. ""It really worries me when I think about younger players coming up, that have to go through this. People that still haven't yet developed fully as a human and that really might be affected by this hate.""
In her post, Garcia also raised the issue of the sport and tournaments partnering with betting companies and speculated on whether that has contributed to a rise in such behavior.
""Tournaments and the sport keeps partnering with betting companies, which keep attracting new people to unhealthy betting,"" Garcia noted. ""The days of cigarette brands sponsoring sports are long gone. Yet, here we are promoting betting companies, which actively destroy the life of some people.""
She continued, ""Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they should be banned as people are free to do whatever they want with their money. But maybe we should not promote them. Also, if someone decided to say this things to me in public, he could have legal issues. So why online we are free to do anything? Shouldn't we reconsider anonymity online?""
Players have called out social media harassment in the past.
""You hear a lot of nasty things, and people talk about your appearance, your family's appearance and all these things,"" Gauff said. ""If you are already struggling with your own mental issues and, on top of that, you have people digging deeper, it is tough.""
As Frances Tiafoe, a semifinalist in New York in 2022, said: ""People are saying outlandish ... stuff. It's just wild.""
""I try not to look at the comments,"" 2019 US Open champion Bianca Andreescu said, mentioning that she will ask her PR person to scroll through and let her know when there are positive ones. ""Because there's always going to be a negative comment and I've learned that the hard way.""
Grand Slam tournaments have been trying to help prevent messages from reaching the athletes.
The French Open partnered in 2022 with a company that uses artificial intelligence to filter players' social media accounts, and the groups that run the US Open, Wimbledon, the women's tour and the lower-level ITF Tour announced in December that they were starting a service to monitor for ""abusive and threatening content"" on X, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and TikTok.
""Many before me have raised the subject,"" Garcia said. ""And still, no progress has been made. Social media platforms don't prevent it, despite AI being in a very advanced position.""
She ended her post with a reminder that athletes, and others in the public eye, are human. ""I know those who write these terrible messages won't change because of this. But maybe you, next time you see a post from an athlete, singer or any other person, that has failed or lost, you will remember that she or he is also a human being, trying his best in life.""
Garcia's message was met with almost immediate support from her peers, including Madison Keys, Katie Boulter and Paula Badosa.
Jessica Pegula, ranked No. 6, agreed with Garcia's sentiment and shared her own experience.
""The constant death threats and family threats are normal now,"" Pegula wrote in response to Garcia. ""Win or lose.""

2024-08-28,Tips to plan the best trip using Meta AI,"""GMA"" sponsor Meta shares how artificial intelligence can help take your family vacation to the next level.","For one high school student in New Jersey, a single computer science competition fueled a mission to get more teenage girls interested in artificial intelligence, or AI.
Ishani Singh, now 17, was a freshman at High Technology High School in 2021 when she attended a state computer science competition, where she noticed she was only one of a few female students competing.
When Singh went onto compete in the regional competition, she said she was ""shocked"" to see that she was the only female student competing.
""I looked around and there were, like, zero girls, and I was like, 'OK,'"" Singh told ABC News in an interview airing on ""The Year: 2024,"" an annual special airing Dec. 26 on ABC. ""That felt a little weird.""
The experience inspired Singh, now a high school senior, to launch Girls Rule AI, which aims to empower young women to learn about AI, a term that, according to NASA, ""refers to computer systems that can perform complex tasks normally done by human-reasoning, decision making, creating, etc.""
Ishani Singh founded Girls Rule AI after attending a computer science competition where she was the only girl.
ABC News
Since the start of the organization nearly three years ago, Girls Rule AI has taught free courses on AI to over 200 girls in 25 states and six countries around the world, including Kenya and Afghanistan, according to Singh.
Gloria Mwangi, a Girls Rule AI instructor in Kenya, said she believes women working in AI-related fields could be transformative.
""In Kenya, the interest in tech and AI is definitely growing,"" Mwangi told ABC News. ""I think AI has a lot of potential to make a difference for young women here.""
Singh added that the success of her company, she believes, has been in making AI more accessible to more girls.

""I think it's just because girls are a little afraid to just start on this journey in the first place,"" Singh said of the gender difference in AI. ""So, I think by creating this community, I was able to make girls feel a little more more comfortable and just get them more confident in this field.""
Even with the progress, Singh said she feels there is a lot of work to do when it comes to getting girls interested in AI so they can go onto careers in the science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, industries.
According to the American Association of University Women, women currently make up 34% of the STEM workforce and are particularly outnumbered by men in fast-growing and high-paying fields like engineering and computer science.
""We're not at the level that we should be,"" Singh said. ""I think there should be more women in the tech field.""

2024-08-27,Artificial intelligence has 'revolutionized' modern firefighting: Here's how,"This year alone, California has battled over 5,500 wildfires, according to Cal Fire.","As California's wildfires alter landscapes, threaten homes and endanger communities, a new ally has emerged for firefighting agencies: artificial intelligence (AI).
Utilizing AI technology in both prevention and response has become a cornerstone of California's firefighting efforts, according to Phillip SeLegue, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's chief of fire intelligence.
""On a daily basis, staff across the state in all of our emergency command centers are monitoring cameras through the ALERTCalifornia network and receiving detections of AI for a possible wildland fire,"" SeLegue told ABC News.
Firefighters work to keep a spot fire from growing as the Park Fire burns along State Route 172 in the Mill Creek community of Tehama County, Calif., Aug. 7, 2024.

Known as a ""camera quilt,"" the network has more than 1,080 high-definition, pan-tilt-zoom cameras deployed across the state.
The camera network, based out of the University of California San Diego, provides a 24-hour backcountry monitoring system with near-infrared night vision to detect and surveil active wildfires.
The camera system has been a success for Cal Fire, SeLegue said, noting how the automated system is faster than placing a 911 call.
In 2023, TIME recognized California's use of AI to detect wildfires as the ""best invention"" of the year.
""California is fighting fires smarter, combining cutting-edge technology with a world-class firefighting force -- all to better protect our communities,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom in a press release at the time.

Fire detection traditionally consisted of people being staffed at fire lookout locations around the state, which SeLegue said is sometimes ""very challenging"" due to remote locations, long shifts and potentially dangerous weather conditions.
""It's reduced the personnel hours when it comes to the deployment of folks sitting up on a hillside or a ridge, knowing that there's inclement weather or knowing that there's high fire potential,"" SeLegue said.

When a wildfire is recorded, emergency command personnel then run fire spread predictions and fire spread simulations through another AI system to see the potential impacts of that fire, according to SeLegue.
Cal Fire has been utilizing Technosylva, a wildfire science and technology company, since 2019.
The AI system runs predictive analytics on historical fire patterns, weather patterns and vegetation types to provide context and a potential roadmap for how the initial blaze could spread.
""We've revolutionized fire modeling,"" Bryan Spear, CEO of Technosylva, told ABC News.

""When you're using the power of AI machine learning, you're able to increase situational awareness and speed up decision-making to a matter of seconds versus minutes or hours,"" Spear said.
The Technosylva system also integrates data from satellites and weather stations to model fire behavior and predict potential wildfire hotspots.
This allows agencies to allocate resources more effectively, implement preventive measures in high-risk areas and prepare for potential outbreaks with more precision, according to Spear.
""Ultimately, it saves lives and saves structures,"" he added.

California firefighters have battled more than 5,500 wildfires this year, with a total of 830,000 acres burned, according to Cal Fire. The state's wildfires have destroyed just over 1,200 structures and led to one civilian death, officials said.
The reality of wildfires in the state has changed over the last 10 years, forcing Cal Fire to adapt its response, according to SeLegue.
""We have already seen early, increased activity and the dryness of the fuels,"" SeLegue said of the state's landscape. ""We continue to see the fuels more receptive to the burn environment, meaning they're more receptive to roadside starts or any type of new ignitions -- whether it's lightning or someone even just mowing their grass.""

A study from the National Integrated Drought Information System released in 2023 found that human-caused climate change contributed to a 172% increase in burned areas from 1971 to 2021.
The 2024 Park Fire, which is now California's fourth-largest wildfire ever, forced fire agencies to utilize a tremendous force of resources -- including AI, according to Spear.

날짜 없음,"NFL, NFLPA sign off on new device to measure field conditions",요약 없음,"The NFL and NFL Players Association have mandated the use of a new device to measure field conditions before regular-season games this season, league officials told ESPN.
The development and introduction of what is known as a ""Strike"" device is part of a larger effort to create a set of universal guidelines for the league's 30 playing surfaces, all while addressing a contentious issue between owners and players in recent years. Those guidelines, NFL field director Nick Pappas said, are expected to be in place for the 2025 season.
""We're going to come up with our own performance specification document for the NFL field,"" Pappas said. ""Ultimately it will be a regulatory document that says, 'Hey, look, an NFL field should meet these standards.' Right now, our standards have been somewhat vague, but it's because we didn't want to just arbitrarily adopt something that could be wrong.""
NFL players have long pushed the league to improve playing surfaces. In 2023, NFLPA executive director Lloyd Howell called on owners to convert the league's 15 artificial turf surfaces to grass. The league has pointed to data that shows a relatively narrow gap of noncontact, lower-body extremity injuries on natural and artificial surfaces, and instead has argued that consistency across surfaces is a more realistic goal.
In addition to the Strike, the league will continue to use its Clegg device to measure field hardness before games. NFL rules require Clegg readings between 50g and 100g for a surface to be approved for play.
The Strike device, built through the league's biomechanical partners, will provide different data that Pappas said will provide a better assessment of field conditions. It will deliver a metric based on two energy measurements. The first is restitution -- how much energy is absorbed by the ground versus being sent back to a player when he steps on it. The second is deformation, the extent to which the surface dimples when it comes into contact with the foot.
Only the Clegg reading will be used for compliance during the 2024 season, but the Strike metrics will be incorporated into next season's guidelines and likely will replace the Clegg in the near future.
""We believe that [the Strike] is more indicative of that initial puncturing of the surface of how a cleat penetrates the surface and displaces infill or displaces sand or root material,"" Pappas said.
""That is what we believe is going to give us a more true value to what the player is feeling and a better way to measure our fields moving forward. The Clegg has done great things for us in the initial low-hanging fruit of getting us to an improved standardization, but there may be some diminishing values at this point on it where we need to take it a step further to better understand our fields.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-08-26,Mate Rimac is going to revolutionize the auto industry. Then he will take a vacation.,"Mate Rimac, the CEO of Bugatti Rimac, promises the ""future of automotive is not going to be boring.""","Mate Rimac has a tall order: trying to convince drivers that electric supercars are superior to combustion vehicles.
Rimac, the 36-year-old engineering savant from Croatia who started his namesake company 15 years ago, recently pulled the sheet of his latest creation: the Nevera R, an aerodynamically perfected supercar designed to hug every tight corner and give maximum driving pleasure. The performance numbers are nearly impossible to comprehend: 2,107 horsepower and a 0-60 mph time of 1.74 seconds.
This insanely powerful supercar is breaking industry records. There are, however, snags in Rimac's master plan. He has acknowledged that turning enthusiasts to electric proselytes could take months, if not years.
Rimac spoke to ABC News earlier this month about the challenges of selling his seven-figure sports cars, taking over French marque Bugatti as CEO and why government officials are making a mistake by pushing electric-vehicle mandates. He's also a big supporter of autonomous driving.
The interview below has been edited.
ABC News: You introduced the Nevera R electric hypercar to the world at Monterey Car Week. The horsepower that car produces -- 2,107! -- is mind-blowing. How did you accomplish this?
Mate: I started the company 15 years ago when I was like 20 years old in order to push the limits and show what technology can bring to the table ... that the future of automotive is not going to be boring. And the whole goal, my whole focus of the company and of me the last few years, has been to achieve that. It's not just the car. It's building the capabilities, the company around it, to actually do it in Croatia, a country that has never built cars before.
The last 15 years of this journey has been leading up to developing this technology, the team, the resources, the factory, the equipment and actually a whole industry.
ABC News: Is horsepower the one metric that matters most to your customers?
Mate: No, absolutely not. It's the whole package. So performance is being commoditized right now. More and more cars come to the market at a relatively affordable cost that offer quite good performance, incredible performance actually when you compare it to a few years ago when it was only reserved for extreme hypercars. It's all about emotions and that's always a challenge with electric cars: How do you convey emotion without the sound of a combustion engine? But everyone who tries a Nevera is like, ""Yes, we can see that this car was developed by people who love cars, like proper car guys."" Despite being electric, the Nevera offers a lot of emotion. That's the most important thing.
ABC News: And how exactly are you delivering that emotion?
Mate: Well, there's different things. The Nevera has four electric motors that can do crazy drift modes and on a flip of a switch it's like a track monster. Everything changes -- the suspension, the power distribution, it goes from rear-wheel drive to all-wheel drive, it can adjust it exactly as you want. Like it gives a totally different experience.
Emotion for me is the ability to go sideways, to control the car, stuff like that. And we can do all of that with this car.
ABC News: Why are you limiting production of the Nevera R to 40 units? When does production begin?
Mate: We want to keep exclusivity. The Bugatti Tourbillon is limited to 250 and we could have sold a lot more, but for us it's important to have exclusivity and it's also important for the value of the cars later.
We start production early next year and the cost of a Nevera R is 2.3 million euros.
The Nevera R, which made its debut at The Quail on Aug. 16, 2024, delivers 2,107 horsepower. Production is limited to 40 units worldwide.
Rimac Group
ABC News: Here we are, talking about the electric Nevera R, an engineering triumph, but you made a comment this past spring that high-end buyers don't want electric supercars. Is that still true? Are you having trouble selling the Nevera to enthusiasts?
Mate: I think electric cars, in any category, need to bring something special. Just making an car electric is not going to cut it. People are thinking, ""Let's just make an electric car and it will sell ... or the regulation will force people to go electric."" And I am not totally against that -- I am totally against forcing this on people who don't want an electric car. I am all for bringing something unique, something cool, something different that's better and maybe more affordable -- maybe not in this market segment but in general.
An electric car should be better in every aspect, including price, compared to its competition and then people will buy it.

ABC News: There's another trend in the industry where automakers are taking electric sports cars but giving them gearboxes and fake engine sounds. Is this something you've thought about?
Mate: No, we don't do this. We have decided from the beginning we only do authentic things. There are no fake sounds, there are no artificial gear shift changes. The Hyundai Ioniq 5 Ns have that, it's a gimmick. But we don't think that's appropriate for this category of cars.
MORE: Internal combustion engines are far from over: 'There was a bit of hype' around EVs, industry watchers say
ABC News: When do you think electric sports and supercars cars will be widely accepted?
Mate: Oh, I think that will be a while. People in this segment still prefer combustion cars. But I think we are the player when it comes to electric performance in this segment.
The Rimac Nevera electric hypercar holds more than 20 performance records.
Rimac Group
ABC News: So will the next Rimac sports car or Nevera successor have an internal combustion engine?
Mate: It could be anything. From the beginning, I never said that we are exclusively electric. We were whatever is most exciting. The Nevera R has four electric motors -- that is not something you can achieve with a combustion engine. But when it comes to power source, it can be anything. It could be a combustion engine with an interesting fuel, it could be fuel cell that does not run on hydrogen. We are really looking at lots of stuff. The next car doesn't necessarily have to be purely electric -- whatever is most exciting and most technically interesting. I have been doing electric cars now for 15 years ... I am very excited to look at other stuff as well.
ABC News: Where are you seeing the most demand for your cars?
Mate: The U.S. is the biggest customer base, closely after that is Europe. So like 40% [of sales] are in the U.S., 30% is Europe and then the rest of the world.
ABC News: What are the challenges of running two high performance and ultra luxe brands like Bugatti and Rimac? They compete for the same customers and that's a very limited pool.
Mate: These customers have multiple cars, it's not just like they buy just one car. They want to be a part of something. It's about the people behind it, it's about the events, meeting each other. [Customers] are becoming part of a story. They're also becoming a part of history. We are creating history together.
Many of the customers decided to join Rimac because they're also part of Bugatti or vice versa and they deal with the same people, they go to Croatia, they have the Croatia experience, so it actually works well. With Bugatti you have to be careful, it's an old brand with a lot of heritage. You have to be very respectful to the brand. You cannot do something that's crazy. A lot of our Nevera customers are also Bugatti customers.
Mate Rimac founded his Croatian electric hypercar company in 2009.
Rimac Group
ABC News: What is the biggest obstacle for all automakers and the industry right now?
Mate: There are three big topics. One is electrification. A lot of people invested a lot into electrification and maybe it was a bit too fast. The other area is China. The third one is autonomous driving and finding new ways of moving around where ownership isn't really necessary anymore. The lower-end brands are really in the trenches, they have issues. It's for sure an interesting time and in the next year we'll see lots of changes in the industry.
ABC News: There are concerns about a recession in the U.S. Has the company been impacted at all?
Mate: This talk has been going on for years, basically since COVID started. We have never been more successful. We sold out of the Tourbillon -- all 250 cars. We just presented it two months ago. It's completely sold out. We are basically sold out until the end of this decade with Bugatti for a car that's $4.6 million. The market is still strong in this segment.
The Bugatti Tourbillon is the first electrified hypercar from the French marque.

ABC News: You're also developing a driverless robotaxi that could be in service as soon as 2026. These types of vehicles have received a lot of bad press lately and have been involved in serious safety accidents. Why robotaxis? You design cars for real-life drivers.
Mate: Yeah, but do you really like to drive in every situation? Like how many times would you rather spend your time doing something else -- watching a movie, or typing on your phone or typing some emails but you can't because you're driving or even worse you're doing it while you're driving. Not every drive is necessarily exciting and let's be honest -- how many people really care about it? I am not saying car ownership should go away or people shouldn't drive cars anymore. God forbid.
We just think it makes sense. When an autonomous car in this stage has an accident, even if it's a minor one, of course it will be blown out of proportion. But eventually autonomous cars will be a lot safer, a lot safer than human drivers and they will save millions of lives.
ABC News: So you have taken over Bugatti, you're building electric hypercars and you also want to build robotaxis. What is next on your list to accomplish?
Mate: [laughs]. Oh Jesus Christ, nothing. I made a vow to myself to finish all these things and then I don't know. I might take a long vacation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

""You can always trust me to put country above party and self, to hold sacred America's fundamental principles, from the rule of law to free and fair elections, to the peaceful transfer of power.""

Throughout her nearly hour-long remarks, Harris took aim at former President Donald Trump and presented her top policies for a Harris-Walz White House.
Read Harris' full remarks at the DNC below
To my husband, Doug, thank you for being an incredible partner to me and father to Cole and Ella. And happy anniversary. I love you so very much.
To Joe Biden -- Mr. President. When I think about the path we have traveled together, I am filled with gratitude. Your record is extraordinary, as history will show. And your character is inspiring. Doug and I love you and Jill. And I am forever thankful to you both.
And to Coach Tim Walz, you are going to be an incredible Vice President. And to the delegates and everyone who has put your faith in our campaign -- your support is humbling.
America, the path that led me here in recent weeks, was no doubt... unexpected. But I'm no stranger to unlikely journeys.
My mother Shyamala Harris had one of her own. I miss her every day, especially now and I know she's looking down tonight and smiling. My mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an unshakeable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer. When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage. But, as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris -- a student from Jamaica -- they fell in love and got married.
And that act of self-determination made my sister Maya and me. Growing up, we moved a lot. I will always remember that big Mayflower truck, packed with all our belongings. Ready to go to Illinois, to Wisconsin and wherever our parents' jobs took us. My early memories of my parents together are joyful ones.
A home filled with laughter and music Aretha, Coltrane and Miles.
At the park, my mother would tell us to stay close, but my father would just smile, and say, ""Run, Kamala Run"" ""Don't be afraid"" ""Don't let anything stop you."" From my earliest years, he taught me to be fearless. But the harmony between my parents did not last. When I was in elementary school, they split up and it was mostly my mother who raised us. Before she could finally afford to buy a home, she rented a small apartment in the East Bay. In the Bay, you either live in the hills or the flatlands. We, lived in the flats. A beautiful working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses and construction workers -- all who tended their lawns with pride.
My mother worked long hours and like many working parents, she leaned on a trusted circle to help raise us. Mrs. Shelton, who ran the daycare below us and became a second mother. Uncle Sherman, Aunt Mary, Uncle Freddy and Auntie Chris. None of them family by blood. And all of them family by love. Family who taught us How to make gumbo. How to play chess. And sometimes even let us win. Family who loved us. Believed in us. And told us we could be anything. Do anything.
They instilled in us the values they personified, community, faith and the importance of treating others as you would want to be treated.
With kindness, respect and compassion, my mother was a brilliant, five-foot-tall, brown woman with an accent. And, as the eldest child, I saw how the world would sometimes treat her -- but she never lost her cool. She was tough. Courageous.
A trailblazer in the fight for women's health. And she taught Maya and me a lesson that Michelle mentioned the other night. She taught us to never complain about injustice but do something about it. She Also taught us -- never do anything half-assed. That's a direct quote.
I grew up immersed in the ideals of the Civil Rights Movement. My parents had met at a civil rights gathering and they made sure we learned about civil rights leaders, including lawyers like Thurgood Marshall and Constance Baker Motley. Those who battled in the courtroom to make real the Promise of America. So, at a young age, I decided I wanted to do that work.
I wanted to be a lawyer and when it came time to choose the type of law I would pursue, I reflected on a pivotal moment in my life. When I was in high school, I started to notice something about my best friend Wanda. She was sad at school and there were times she didn't want to go home. So, one day I asked if everything was alright. And she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us. And she did.
That is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor. To protect people like Wanda because I believe everyone has a right to safety, to dignity and to justice.
As a prosecutor, when I had a case I charged it not in the name of the victim, but in the name of ""The People."" For a simple reason.
In our system of justice, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. I would often explain this to console survivors of crime. To remind them, no one should be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. Every day in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and said five words: ""Kamala Harris, for the People.""
And to be clear: My entire career, I have only had one client. The People.
And so, on behalf of The People, on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender or the language your grandmother speaks. On behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey. On behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with.
People who work hard, chase their dreams, and look out for one another.
On behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth. I accept your nomination for President of the United States of America. With this election, our nation has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past.
A chance to chart a new way forward, not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans.
I know there are people of various political views watching tonight and I want you to know: I promise to be a President for all Americans. You can always trust me to put country above party and self. To hold sacred America's fundamental principles. From the rule of law. To free and fair elections.
To the peaceful transfer of power: I will be a President who unites us around our highest aspirations.
A President who leads and listens, who is realistic, practical and has common sense. And always fights for the American people.
From the courthouse to the White House, that has been my life's work. As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. As Attorney General of California, I took on the Big Banks.Delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a Homeowner Bill of Rights— one of the first of its kind.
I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by Big for-Profit colleges, for workers who were being cheated out of the wages they were due, for seniors facing elder abuse.
I fought against cartels who traffic in guns, drugs and human beings. Who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities. Those fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices.
We were underestimated at every turn. But we never gave up. Because the future is always worth fighting for. And that's the fight we are in right now. A fight for America's future. Fellow Americans, this election is not only the most important of our lives. It is one of the most important in the life of our nation. In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man.
But the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious. Consider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office, but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election. Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite. He fanned the flames. And now, for an entirely different set of crimes, he was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans.
And separately, found liable for committing sexual abuse. And consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free the violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol. His explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents, anyone he sees as the enemy. His explicit intent to deploy our active-duty military against our own citizens.
Consider the power he will have -- especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled he would be immune from criminal prosecution. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails.
How he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States. Not to improve your life. Not to strengthen our national security. But to serve the only client he has ever had: Himself.
And we know what a second Trump term would look like. It's all laid out in ""Project 2025."" Written by his closest advisors. And its sum total is to pull, our country back into the past. But America, we are not going back. We are not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. We are not going back to when he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.
When insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. We are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools. We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide preschool and child care. America, we are not going back.
We are charting a new way forward. Forward -- to a future with a strong and growing middle class. Because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to America's success. And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. This is personal for me. The middle class is where I come from. My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means. Yet, we wanted for little. And she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us. And to be grateful for them. Because opportunity is not available to everyone.
That's why we will create what I call an ""opportunity economy.""
An opportunity economy where everyone has a chance to compete and a chance to succeed. Whether you live in a rural area, small town, or big city. As President, I will bring together labor and workers, small business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs, grow our economy and lower the cost of everyday needs -- like health care, housing and groceries.
We will provide access to capital for small business owners, entrepreneurs, and founders. We will end America's housing shortage and protect Social Security and Medicare. Compare that to Donald Trump. He doesn't actually fight for the middle class. Instead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends. He will give them another round of tax breaks, that will add 5 trillion dollars to the national debt.
All while he intends to enact what, in effect, is a national sales tax -- call it, a Trump tax -- that would raise prices on middle-class families by almost $4,000 a year.
Well, instead of a Trump tax hike, we will pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans.
Friends, I believe America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives. Especially on matters of heart and home. But tonight, too many women in America are not able to make those decisions. Let's be clear about how we got here.
Donald Trump hand-picked members of the United States Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom. And now he brags about it. His words: quote ""I did it, and I'm proud to have done it."" End quote.
Over the past two years, I have traveled across our country and women have told me their stories. Husbands and fathers have shared theirs. Stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot, getting sepsis, losing the ability to ever have children again.
All because doctors are afraid of going to jail for caring for their patients. Couples just trying to grow their family, cut off in the middle of IVF treatments. Children who have survived sexual assault, potentially forced to carry the pregnancy to term. This is what is happening in our country because of Donald Trump.
And understand he is not done. As a part of his agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion and enact a nation-wide abortion ban with or without Congress. And, get this, he plans to create a National Anti-Abortion Coordinator and force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions.
Simply put: They are out of their minds.
And one must ask: Why exactly is it that they don't trust women? Well, we trust women.
And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law.
In this election, Many other fundamental freedoms are at stake. The freedom to live safe from gun violence -- in our schools, communities, and places of worship -- the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. The freedom to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis. And the freedom that unlocks all the others: the freedom to vote.
With this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. And let me be clear: after decades in law enforcement, I know the importance of safety and security, especially at our border.
Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades. The Border Patrol endorsed it, but Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign.
So he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal.
Well, I refuse to play politics with our security. Here is my pledge to you: As President, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed. And I will sign it into law.
I know we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants -- and reform our broken immigration system.
We can create an earned pathway to citizenship -- and secure our border. America, we must also be steadfast in advancing our security and our values abroad.
As Vice President, I have confronted threats to our security, negotiated with foreign leaders, strengthened our alliances and engaged with our brave troops overseas.
As Commander-in-Chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families.
And I will always honor, and never disparage, their service and their sacrifice.
I will make sure that we lead the world into the future on space and Artificial Intelligence, that America -- not China -- wins the competition for the 21st century, and that we strengthen -- not abdicate -- our global leadership.
Trump, on the other hand, threatened to abandon NATO. He encouraged Putin to invade our allies, he aid Russia could ""do whatever the hell they want."" Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine, I met with President Zelenskyy to warn him about Russia's plan to invade.
I helped mobilize a global response -- over 50 countries -- to defend against Putin's aggression. And as President, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.
With respect to the war in Gaza, President Biden and I are working around the clock because now is the time to get a hostage deal and cease-fire done.
Let me be clear: I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that the terrorist organization Hamas caused on Oct. 7.
Including unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival. At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again.
The scale of suffering is heartbreaking. President Biden and I are working to end this war such that - Israel is secure - the hostages are released - the suffering in Gaza ends - and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity.
Security. Freedom. And self-determination. And know this: I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists. And I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim-Jong-Un, who are rooting for Trump. Because they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors.
They know Trump won't hold autocrats accountable, because he wants to be an autocrat.
As President, I will never waver in defense of America's security and ideals. Because, in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand -- and where the United States of America belongs. Fellow Americans, I love our country with all my heart. Everywhere I go, in everyone I meet, I see a nation ready to move forward, ready for the next step, in the incredible journey that is America.
I see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation.
That inspired the world. That here, in this country, anything is possible, nothing is out of reach.
An America, where we care for one another, look out for one another and recognize that we have so much more in common than what separates us.
That none of us has to fail for all of us to succeed and that, in unity, there is strength.
Our opponents in this race are out there, everyday, denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is.
Well, my mother had another lesson she used to teach: Never let anyone tell you who you are. You show them who you are. America, Let us show each other -- and the world -- who we are and what we stand for. Freedom. Opportunity. Compassion. Dignity. Fairness.
And endless possibilities.
We are the heirs to the greatest democracy, in the history of the world. And on behalf of our children and grandchildren and all those who sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and liberty, we must be worthy of this moment. It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done.
Guided by optimism and faith, to fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth.
The privilege and pride of being an American.
So, let's get out there and let's fight for it. Let's get out there and let's vote for it. And together, let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told. Thank you. God bless you. May God bless the United States of America.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-08-22,Trump speaks from behind bulletproof glass at 1st outdoor rally since Butler shooting,"Donald Trump spoke behind bulletproof glass at his first outdoor rally since the assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania last month.","Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday delivered his latest campaign trail remarks protected by bulletproof glass and multiple visible counter snipers on top of nearby buildings – his first outdoor campaign event not at his properties since a gunman attempted his life at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last month.
It was his third counterprogramming event of the week against the Democratic National Convention, continuing with the series of events in battleground states focused on key election issues this year.
In Asheboro, North Carolina, on Wednesday, Trump focused on national security, attacking the Biden-Harris administration on ongoing foreign conflicts, the Afghanistan withdrawal, American hostage deals and other issues.
Contrary to his intimate and small counterprogramming events in Pennsylvania and Michigan earlier this week, this was his biggest campaign event so far this week. Trump – with the American flag in the backdrop just like in Butler – speaking in an open field in front of thousands of supporters, including some who told ABC News they were at the Butler rally and said the set up in Asheboro reminded them of the Butler rally.
As ABC News previously reported, the U.S. Secret Service has ordered multiple sets of bulletproof glass panels to be stored around the country so it can be trucked to wherever it's needed, sources said. While the measure is typically reserved exclusively for sitting presidents, the Secret Service has made an exception following the attempt on Trump's life.

MORE: Secret Service prepares use of bulletproof glass for outdoor Trump rallies: Sources
The Secret Service had recommended that Trump stop holding outdoor rallies last month after a gunman in Butler fired at him from a rooftop 400 feet from the stage, nicking his ear and killing a spectator in the crowd.
Since July 13, Trump has held nearly a dozen campaign events, all of them indoors.
Claiming the United States was respected during his administration, Trump repeatedly painted a grim picture of a possible Kamala Harris presidency, saying, ""If Comrade Kamala wins this November, World War three is virtually guaranteed to happen. Everything she touches, she destroys.""
Escalating his attacks on the sitting vice president, Trump began to directly blame Harris for the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, even falsely claiming that Harris met with Russian President Vladimir Putin days before the Russia-Ukraine war broke out.
""Remember when Biden sent Kamala to Europe to stop the war in Ukraine? She met with Putin, and then three days later, he attacked,"" Trump falsely claimed. ""How did she do it? Think she did a good job. She met with Putin to tell him, don't do it. And three days later he attacked. That's when the attack started.""
In reality, there's no public record of Harris meeting with Putin. Instead, she met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at a security conference in Munich five days before the war broke out.

Trump also suggested Harris was responsible for the way U.S. troops left Afghanistan, saying ""she was the last person in the room with Biden when the two of them decided to pull the troops out of Afghanistan.""
""She had the final vote; she had the final say, and she was all for it,"" Trump said, later promising to hold the Biden-Harris administration accountable by asking for the resignations of ""every single senior military official who touched the Afghanistan disaster.""
Trump also claimed he would have handled the Afghanistan withdrawal better, claiming he has had conversations with the head of Taliban and that he ""respected"" him.
""Our adversaries knew that America was not to be trifled with when I was your commander in chief,"" Trump said. ""... But since the Afghanistan catastrophe, it's been open season on America and our allies.""
Trump also railed against ""woke"" military generals throughout his speech, claiming, ""I know the good ones, the weak ones,"" praising his former military officials like Gen. Keith Kellogg.
Offering a glimpse of what his second term would look like, Trump declared ""the days of blank checks for the weapons systems"" are over and said he will build ""a great Iron Dome"" and give it to other countries like Israel.
""We will increase funding, but at the same time, the days of blank checks for the weapons systems over the past are over. I tell you what we will build, we're going to build a great Iron Dome over our country so that we don't have to get hit. We give it to other countries, we help Israel and other countries,"" Trump said.
Trump also said he would ""aggressively"" shift funding to ""keep American on the cutting edge, investing in drones and other technology, saying he wants to invest ""heavily"" in ""drones and robotics and artificial intelligence and hypersonics.""
Even as he focused on policies, Trump dismissed the idea of stopping personal attacks on Harris – at one point, mocking his advisers for suggesting he should stick to policy and stray away from personal attacks. He then said that many speakers at the Democratic National Convention personally attacked him, referencing Barack and Michelle Obamas speeches last night.
Trump then polled the crowd to see if he should ""get personal,"" followed by many in the crowd cheering. Prior to Obama's speech last night, Trump spoke highly of the former president, but quickly shifted his tone saying he was ""nasty.""
""Did you see Barack Hussein Obama last night? He was taking shots at your president. And so is Michelle. They always say, please stick to policy, don't get personal. Yet they are getting personal all night long, these people. Do I still have to stick to policy?""
""I try and be nice to people, you know, but it's a little tough when they get personal,"" Trump said.
""He was very nasty last night. I try and be nice,"" Trump said about former Obama's speech at the DNC Tuesday night.
""Should I not get personal? he asked the crowd. After few agreed, Trump quipped, ""I don't know -- my advisers are fired.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-08-22,"AI-powered brain-computer interface could help Parkinson’s Disease, study shows",A trial of four patients revealed that an AI-powered brain implant may help calm involuntary movements for people with Parkinson’s Disease. Dr. Darien Sutton explains.,"Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-08-21,Harris holds rally at Milwaukee arena where Trump accepted Republican nomination at RNC,Vice President Kamala Harris held a rally Tuesday night in Milwaukee -- in the middle of the Democratic National Convention.,"Vice President Kamala Harris held a raucous rally Tuesday night in Milwaukee -- in the middle of the Democratic National Convention -- at the same arena where former President Donald Trump accepted the Republican nomination just a month ago.
A Harris campaign official said they weren't just doing a ""victory lap"" because of the momentum around the vice president -- instead choosing to hold a rally during the DNC because they still say they believe they are the ""underdogs"" and need to work hard to win over voters in battleground states such as Wisconsin, the official said.
These critical voters won't be in Chicago, and Harris needs to ""meet them where they are,"" the official said.

""Good evening, Milwaukee!"" Harris told the wildly cheering crowd. And hello to everyone joining us from exciting Chicago,"" Harris said to the DNC from the Wisconsin stage. ""The delegates at the Democratic National Convention, well, they just completed their roll call and they have nominated Coach Walz and me to be the next vice president and president of the United States of America. And I thank everyone there and here for believing in what we can do together.""
""We are so honored to be your nominees,"" Harris continued. ""This is a people powered campaign, and together we will chart a new way forward. A future for freedom. Opportunity of optimism and faith. So, to everyone in Chicago and across America. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,"" she said. ""I'll see you in two days Chicago.""
Milwaukee is ""a place where we need to increase turnout and it's a good high-momentum, high-energy moment to dig in and talk to folks,"" the campaign official added before the rally. ""We want to make this bigger than Chicago.""
Harris' Tuesday event took place in the Fiserv Forum -- the location of the Republican National Convention's prime-time events and where Trump recently accepted his party's nomination to a packed house.

""If she can fill up that arena that can hold some 18,000 people -- that could get under Trump's skin,"" the campaign official said -- a reference to Trump's focus on crowd size.
In recent weeks, Trump has continued to make baseless claims that the Harris campaign pays for her crowd as his Democratic rival gains momentum with large-scale rallies.
Earlier this month, Trump falsely accused Harris' campaign of using artificial intelligence to fabricate crowds at a campaign rally in Michigan. A Harris campaign official told ABC News that the photo Trump called into question was taken by a Harris campaign staffer and that it was ""not modified by AI in any way.""
MORE: Harris is starting to rebuild the Biden coalition
Harris' visit to Wisconsin comes after she spoke at the DNC briefly on Monday night. She is set to speak again at the convention on Thursday night where she will accept the party's nomination. Her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff is set to speak at the convention Tuesday night ahead of keynote speakers former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama.
Democratic voters in the area said Harris needs to frequently visit Wisconsin to win the crucial battleground state. In 2020, President Joe Biden beat Trump by a narrow margin; in 2016, Trump won the state by an extremely narrow margin of about 22,700 votes over Hillary Clinton -- less than 1%.
Democratic voters noted that Harris is already doing more than Clinton in 2016, when the former secretary of state did not visit Wisconsin during the general election.

""The last time I felt this much excitement was when Obama ran,"" said Wisconsin resident Shannon Mattner, who is planning to attend Harris' rally. ""We just feel like there's more hope now.""
Daniel Barfouth, a union member from Wisconsin set to attend the rally, says he supports Harris because of her position on unions.
""I like what she has to say about unions. I like how the unions endorsed her,"" Barfouth said.
Barfourth drew a sharp contrast between Harris and Trump: ""He talks about chaos. He doesn't talk about hope, connection or anything about love. He talks about tearing everything down.""
Asked what Harris needs to do to win Wisconsin, Barfourth said that Harris needs to continue ""putting herself out there as a normal person like everyone else: 'I'm one of you'. Trump isn't one of us. He was born with a silver spoon with his mouth. He hasn't had to suffer for anything.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-08-20,"First-time voters discuss political issues at gathering in Washington, DC",The “America in One Room: The Youth Vote” event brought hundreds of young voters from a variety of backgrounds together.,"Hundreds of first-time voters from all over the United States gathered in Washington, D.C., in July for a political experiment: a rare opportunity to discuss the 2024 presidential election’s top issues with strangers for three days straight.
The gathering, called “America in One Room: The Youth Vote,” was a collaboration between Close Up Foundation, Stanford University, the Generation Lab, global problem solving organization Helena and the Neely Center at USC Marshall. ABC News’ Christiane Cordero was there, talking to some of the young voters for “GMA3.”
The “America in One Room: The Youth Vote"" gathering brought first-time voters from around the country together.
ABC News
The group of roughly 500 young adults from a variety of backgrounds spent part of their time together in one room. Otherwise, they gathered in small groups for face-to-face talks about different policy issues. Those issues range from the deeply divisive, like the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, to those with a direct impact on their lives.
For Emilea Johnson from Goodridge, Minnesota, a town with a population of around 112, that issue is health care.
“My dad is a farmer. My mom works at the church, which offers no benefits,” Johnson told Cordero. “So navigating the world of health care is extremely challenging when you have to try and figure it out on your own.”
Despite how personal the issue of health care feels, Johnson said she doesn’t have a problem hearing from someone who disagrees with her. Chardon Black from Cleveland, Ohio, expressed concern that many people in the U.S. consider others disagreeing with them to be a form of insult.
""I’ve learned that disagreements are OK and disagreements are fine, as long as you’re expressing yourself in your opinion and the things you care about,” he said.
Before and after the event, participants were asked to share how they felt about a range of issues.
“This is what polling should be,” Henry Elkus, founder and CEO of Helena, said.
The Deliberative Poll found that the weekend experience increased the participants’ satisfaction with democracy from 29% to 58%
Opposition to a nationwide ban on abortion medication increased from 78% to 80%, the survey said, including among those who identified as Republican.
However, support for increasing the federal minimum wage dropped from 62% to 48%, according to the survey.
Emilea Johnson, Chardon Black and Elaine Gombos – from Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania respectively - discussed the issues they felt most strongly about.
ABC News
And while many participants said they were committed to climate action, after the event support for the U.S. achieving energy independence increased from 62% to 76%, the survey said.
Elkus highlighted a distinct lack of interest in partisan politics among participants.
“They don't care about the candidates, they care about the issues,” he told “GMA3.” “We see this over and over and over again. They have a very grounded and felt sense that we need to fix this country.”
The ultimate goal was to reach consensus on one thing: take the lessons learned at the gathering and share them.
“Democracy is collaborative, and I hope that everyone will have access to such safe environments for us to share our stories, conversations and to deliberate,” Elaine Gombos from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, said in a video diary after the event.
These young voters will be polled again closer to Election Day, to see if their views have shifted. The event’s sponsors are considering doing another event in 2025 – one that focuses on views about artificial intelligence.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-08-16,Review: 'Alien: Romulus' is hard to resist,"Film critic Peter Travers shares his review of ""Alien: Romulus.""","As we learned in the first ""Alien"" 45 years ago, in space, no one can hear you scream. That rule doesn't work at the movies, where ""Alien Romulus"" -- the seventh film in the franchise -- opens this Friday in theaters, where we can, should and will hear you scream your bloody head off.
Set between the twin peaks of the series -- Sir Ridley Scott's 1979 ""Alien"" and King of the World James Cameron's 1986 ""Aliens"" -- this so-called ""interquel"" shamelessly feeds off the DNA of both sci-fi horror classics. Look at it this way: If you can't have originality, you can still enjoy the serviceable funhouse horrors dished out by new director Fede Álvarez (""Don't Breathe"").
Speaking of odious comparisons, no one will ever equal, much less surpass, Sigourney Weaver as warrant officer Ellen Ripley. For ""Aliens,"" Weaver was nominated as best actress (an Oscar first for sci-fi) and I'll never forgive the academy for choosing Marlee Matlin over Weaver for ""Children of a Lesser God."" No slight on Matlin, but please.

Review: 'Trap' quickly dives off the cliff from disappointment to disaster
Luckily, ""Alien: Romulus"" star Cailee Spaeny is not playing a guppie Ripley. The role for the young actress, who excelled as Priscilla Presley in ""Priscilla"" and a newbie photojournalist in ""Civil War,"" is Rain Carradine, an orphan desperate to end her servitude on the Weyland-Yutani mining colony to live and work on a planet where she can actually see her future and the sun.
That would be on the farming planet of Yvaga. But before she can earn her travel papers, Rain is conscripted to do service on the disease-ridden mine with her droid brother Andy, fabulously played by British actor David Jonsson, one of the shining lights on TV's ""Industry.""
Disney's new movie, 'Alien Romulus'.
Disney
Andy has been programmed by Rain's late father with one purpose: to keep her safe. Good luck with that.
That's when Rain and Andy concoct an escape plan with a crew of young humans, including Rain's ex, Tyler (Archie Renaux), his sister Kay (a stellar Isabela Merced), who's been keeping her pregnancy secret, Kay's annoying boyfriend Bjorn (Spike Fearn), and Navarro (Aileen Wu), a pilot who thinks seizing a decommissioned space module named Romulus is their best ticket out.

Not so fast. First of all, in mythology, Romulus only founded Rome after killing his twin brother Remus. So that means chaos ahead as the crew encounters horrifying creatures from facehuggers and xenomorphs to every grotesque dripping monstrosity Alvarez can clone from H.R. Geiger's original alien designs.
And watch out, Andy suddenly has a menacing glint in his synthetic eye. Yikes!
Whether you cheer or jeer the use of artificial intelligence to resurrect a character from the first ""Alien"" -- sorry, no spoiler from me -- the AI will sure as hell grab your attention, not to mention a stern warning from SAG/AFTRA execs trying to protect actors from AI bodysnatching.

Review: 'Industry' reveals a broken world that looks scarily like our own
Kudos to Alvarez for mostly avoiding easy digital tricks in favor of practical effects that seem scarily real. After the thundering last third of the film, which turns up the terror to 11, you'll want to bolt for the shower to get the goo off. Yup, it feels that tangible.

Alvarez brings in so many callbacks to other ""Alien"" films that you may think you're watching a greatest hits reel. And though the filmmaker is clearly not averse to mining the series for a big box-office payoff, you can feel his fanboy passion for all things ""Alien"" in every frame.
That's hard to resist.
""Alien: Romulus"" lacks the groundbreaking freshness to stand with the giants that are ""Alien"" and ""Aliens,"" but you can do worse than this summer blast at the movies with old friends who look like they want to kill you. That's entertainment.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-08-13,Trump falsely claims Harris' campaign used AI to alter photo of crowd size,Former President Donald Trump falsely accused Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign of using AI-altered images of the campaign's airport hangar rally in Michigan.,"In a social media post on Sunday, former President Donald Trump falsely accused Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign of using artificial intelligence to fabricate crowds at a campaign rally in Michigan last week.
The picture referenced by Trump shows a large crowd waiting to see Harris speak at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport on Aug. 7
A Harris campaign official told ABC News that the photo Trump called into question was taken by a Harris campaign staffer and that it was ""not modified by AI in any way.""

""The photo in question was taken by a staffer on their iPhone 12 Pro at 6:28PM on August 7, at the rally at the Detroit Airport,"" the campaign official told ABC News in a statement.
ABC News obtained the original image and was able to verify the metadata matched with the timing of the event.
Harris' Aug. 7 rally in Detroit, Michigan, was the third event of her battleground blitz since Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz joined the ticket. The campaign touts that more than 15,000 people attended the rally.
By comparison, the first public appearance that Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance shared had more than 12,000 spectators in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Trump's campaign said.
The Harris campaign said there were more than 10,000 supporters at each stop on Harris and Walz's battleground state blitz last week.
The Harris campaign also disputed Trump's accusations in multiple social media posts and attacked Trump for not campaigning in a swing state as the former president spent the weekend campaigning and fundraising in Western states.

""Oh, give me a break,"" Trump replied to the reporter.
""I have 10 times, 20 times, 30 times the crowd size. And they never say the crowd was big. That's why I'm always saying, turn around the cameras,"" Trump said.

Trump then went on to compare the crowd that gathered for his speech in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2021, to Martin Luther King Jr. 's 1963 March on Washington, which the civil rights leader delivered to an estimated crowd of 200,000 people, according to the U.S. Census.
""I've spoken to the biggest crowds. Nobody's spoken to crowds bigger than me. If you look at Martin Luther King when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, same real estate, same everything, same number of people. If not, we had more. And they said he had a million people, but I had 25,000 people,"" Trump said.

2024-08-13,How did the stock market bounce back from its worst day in years?,The S&P 500 suffered its worst day since 2022. Then it recovered within days. Here's how.,"Volatility overtook the stock market last week, amplifying worries about a possible recession and stoking panic among investors.
By the end of the week, however, the markets had almost fully recovered. Days after suffering its worst trading day since 2022, the S&P 500 rallied for its best trading session dating back to that same year. For the week, the S&P 500 ended nearly flat, inching downward 0.05%.
The rapid recovery is owed to a realization among traders that risk of an impending recession, as well as damage from a selloff on the Japanese stock market, had likely been overstated, experts told ABC News. The drop-off in stock prices transitioned quickly from an alarm blaring across Wall Street, to an opportunity for traders seeking newly discounted shares, they said.
""When we panic, we lower our expectations so far that any news short of disaster feels like rain in the desert. Then, people pile back in,"" Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, said in a Monday blog post about the recovery.
""When lots of investors brace for a punch – or sell their stocks – they tend to discover that the actual punch doesn't hurt as bad,"" Cox added.
MORE: Trump wants a role in setting interest rates. Some economists say it's a bad idea
The stock market downswing was set off by a disappointing jobs report earlier this month. Employers hired 114,000 workers in July, falling well short of economist expectations of 185,000 jobs. Additionally, the unemployment rate climbed to 4.3%, the highest level since October 2021.
The lackluster jobs data fueled concern about a potential recession, as well as calls for an interest rate cut.
The heightened worry about an economic cooldown coincided with interest rate hikes imposed by Japan's central bank. Those rising rates prompted an unwinding of a so-called ""carry trade"" in which investors borrowed Japanese yen at low interest rates and used it to purchase assets, including U.S. stocks.
When Japan then hiked interest rates, investors sold off some of those assets and sent stock prices falling. Japan's main Nikkei 225 stock index last Monday dropped more than 12%, its worst trading session since 1987. The following day, however, the index soared 10%, then increased slightly over the remainder of the week.
The seesaw performance of the Nikkei 225 mirrored that of U.S. stocks, Avanidhar Subrahmanyam, a professor of finance at the University of California, Los Angeles, told ABC News.
""People saw a buying opportunity and stepped in,"" Subrahmanyam said, noting that markets often recover quickly from a downturn. ""The entire episode was simply a panic followed by a correction.""

Between 1980 and 2023, the S&P 500 posted a positive return over each calendar year 82% of the time, Wells Fargo Investment Institute told clients in a note last week. The market experienced a drop-off of at least 10% in nearly half of those years, Wells Fargo said, adding, ""The data shows that a market downturn does not necessarily mean markets will perform poorly for the year.""
Prior to last week's volatility, the stock market had displayed a banner performance in 2024. Before the weak jobs report on Aug. 2, the S&P 500 had climbed more than 14% this year.

In turn, some observers believed that stocks had become overpriced. While the prices reflected robust corporate profits, they also had soared on account of enthusiasm about artificial intelligence and optimism about the chances of an economic ""soft landing,"" some experts told ABC News.
The perception of overpriced stocks left the market vulnerable to a fit of bad news that could exacerbate those jitters, the experts added.
""When there's a perception that things are overvalued, people are already nervous,"" said Subrahmanyam, of the University of California, Los Angeles. ""When any small precipitating factor occurs, the sellers panic.""
However, the price gains over the ensuing days suggested a view among some traders that such worries had gone too far, Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida, told ABC News. The rapid recovery, he added, appeared to indicate a recognition that strong stock performance this year had been fueled in part by one of the market's most fundamental metrics: corporate profits.
""U.S. earnings have gone up so much more than the rest of the world,"" Ritter told ABC News. ""So the stock market has gone up a lot.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-08-12,"Harris, Walz gain momentum as they visit battleground states","A New York Times/Siena poll shows Vice President Kamala Harris has a four-point edge on former President Donald Trump in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, within the margin of error.","Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""

2024-08-09,"Erythritol could elevate heart disease risk, study suggests","ABC News' Dr. Darien Sutton explains what to know about a new study on erythritol, a popular artificial sweetener.","Nearly 12 years ago, Jessie Owen's life changed forever.
""My family was going over a mountain pass and a tree fell on our car. In that moment, my parents passed away, my siblings were severely injured, and I became quadriplegic,"" Owen said. ""I lost my independence. I lost my job. I lost my apartment. I lost my autonomy and the life that I dreamed for myself.""
Like Owen, more than 300,000 people live with spinal cord injuries in the United States, with an estimated 18,000 new cases each year, data shows.
Motor vehicle accidents account for the majority of spinal cord injuries and are closely followed by falls, acts of violence and sports activities, according to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center.
Jessie Owen was left paralyzed nearly 12 years ago when a tree fell on a car in which she was a passenger.

For years, options for recovery have been limited, but a newly FDA-cleared external spinal stimulator, ARC-EX Therapy, which received clearance on Dec. 19, may offer hope for people like Owen.
""ARC-EX is simply electrodes attached to skin on the back of the neck,"" explained Chet Moritz, Ph.D., a professor of rehabilitation medicine at the University of Washington. ""It allows us to pass current through the skin to activate the sensory nerves as they enter the spinal cord. Now, those sensory nerves make direct connections to the motor nerves which help people to move.""

Owen, who participated in the Up-LIFT study, a clinical trial focusing on the health benefits of ARC-EX Therapy, saw a life-changing impact.
""I was wildly surprised and pleased to see that it was making meaningful change in my life. I can now paint with my hands. I can open a jar of peanut butter. I can tie my shoes. It [used to] take me 30 minutes to get dressed. Now it takes 12. [I used to require] 20 caregiving hours a week and I was able to move down to about eight.""

The Up-LIFT study produced promising results.
Of the 60 patients with cervical spinal cord injuries studied, 72% saw improvements in hand strength and function. Participants also reported fewer muscle spasms, better sleep, less pain, and improved independence during daily activities.
""The success of [this] study of people with spinal cord injuries is phenomenal,"" noted Moritz. ""There are essentially no current therapies for chronic spinal cord injury, and so having the majority of patients respond in both strength and function measures [is] just an outstanding result.""

With FDA approval, ARC-EX Therapy is expected to become more accessible.
""Patients can work with their local rehabilitation clinics to see a therapist and work with them in the clinic at first to tune the device,"" Moritz said. Results may appear quickly -- some participants noticed changes within just a few sessions, he added.
While the device is currently cleared for improving hand strength, function and sensation, Moritz noted other benefits: ""Some people will have modest improvements in their bladder function, heart rate, or blood pressure control.""
Leah Croll, M.D., vascular neurologist at Maimonides Health and assistant professor of neurology at SUNY Downstate, shared the excitement over the device.
""The idea that ARC-EX Therapy may accelerate or augment neurologic recovery is really exciting. Any improvement in neurologic function is meaningful and has far-reaching impact in the daily lives of these patients and their families,"" she said.
The road to recovery after a spinal cord injury is grueling, Croll said.
""After emergency and ICU care is completed, the mainstay of treatment is working closely with physical therapists, occupational therapists and other rehabilitation professionals to support neurologic recovery,"" said Croll. ""Patients may also need medications and certain procedures, depending on their unique symptoms.""
For Owen and others, ARC-EX Therapy represents a renewed sense of hope and an exciting change in the way these patients can be treated.
""[With ARC-EX Therapy], I continued to gain function back, and I found I was able to pour more into other people,"" Owen said. ""The first indicator of success that I noticed was my own happiness. It works, and it gives us hope and passion.""

As Iger prepares to headline this year's D23 fan event in Anaheim, California, there is much creativity to celebrate.
Just this summer, The Walt Disney Company earned a record-breaking 183 Emmy nominations and released two blockbuster movies, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" and ""Inside Out 2.""
""Every single transaction that this company experiences emanates from great creativity and great storytelling. It all starts right there,"" Iger told ABC News' Rebecca Jarvis in an interview that aired Friday on ""Good Morning America."" ""And when I returned to the company in 2022 ... it was very, very clear to me that we had to put creativity back to basically the center of this company.""
Disney CEO Bob Iger speaks during an interview with ABC News' Rebecca Jarvis.

One upcoming movie release Disney fans are looking forward to this fall is ""Moana 2,"" the trailer for which set a Disney record with 178 million views in its first 24 hours.
Iger said he has watched the sequel and can confirm it is ""very exciting.""
""We learned in the first film just what an unbelievable adventurer Moana is ... and I can only say that she is going to prove that yet again to us,"" Iger said, giving fans a small sneak peek of what's ahead for Moana. ""And she has a great relationship with her younger sister, who is kind of a breakout star of the film to come in many ways.""

Iger also spoke about another fan-favorite animated movie, ""Inside Out 2,"" that, earlier this summer, broke records at the box office, earning over $1.5 billion to date and becoming the highest-grossing animated film of all time globally, according to Disney.
When asked by Jarvis whether fans could expect an ""Inside Out 3,"" Iger said he ""would love"" to see that movie made.
""I'll just leave it at that,"" he added.

The first movie Iger said he ever saw was another Disney classic, ""Cinderella,"" which his grandparents took him to see at the age of five.
Decades later, even as technology has evolved and people's options for consuming content have increased, Iger said that the importance of storytelling, whether through a movie like ""Cinderella"" or a streaming show, has remained.
""I started at ABC 50 years ago, so I've been in the entertainment business in some form or another for five decades, and over that period of time, almost everything has changed,"" Iger said. ""One thing has not changed, and that is the importance of and the power of storytelling, and the need for people and the want of people to be entertained, and I think that's probably never been as true as it is today. It's something the world needs.""
And when it comes to other changes in technology, including advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), Iger said he believes Disney needs to advance with the future while staying true to its core.
""I think, first of all, it's really important that in a world where technology provides people with these visual experiences that are stunning in many ways, and look real, I think we have to remember that the experience of coming to one of our parks is an immersive experience in a physical environment,"" Iger said. ""The reality here is reality. It's real, you know, and I think that's important, so I don't want to lose that.""
He continued, ""But we also know that there are new generations of people in our world grow up with these incredible and stunning visual images, so you have to deliver on that expectation, too.""

2024-08-09,"Artificial sweetener erythritol could elevate heart disease risk, preliminary research suggests",Erythritol is found in everything from drinks and baked goods to gum and candy.,"A new study suggests a popular artificial sweetener found in everything from drinks and baked goods to gum and candy could be linked to a higher risk of blood clots, but the researchers themselves say their findings are preliminary and more research is needed to understand any potential health risks.
Erythritol, a zero-calorie sweetener widely used in sugar replacement or reduced-sugar products, was found to increase levels of proteins associated with blood clotting compared to regular sugar, according to a new study published Thursday in the medical journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology.
""This research raises some concerns that a standard serving of an erythritol-sweetened food or beverage may acutely stimulate a direct clot-forming effect,"" the study's co-author, Dr. W. H. Wilson Tang, research director for Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation Medicine at Cleveland Clinic, said in a statement announcing the study's findings. ""Erythritol and other sugar alcohols that are commonly used as sugar substitutes should be evaluated for potential long-term health effects especially when such effects are not seen with glucose itself.""
For the study, 10 people were randomly assigned to drink water mixed with 30 grams of erythritol, while another 10 individuals were randomly assigned to drink water mixed with 30 grams of glucose.
The amount of 30 grams was chosen because it is the quantity commonly found quantity in erythritol-containing foods, according to the Cleveland Clinic researchers who led the study.

The people who drank water mixed with erythritol were found 30 minutes later to have a higher level level of proteins involved in platelet clumping in their bloodstream compared to those who drank glucose.
Erythritol is a sugar alcohol that is naturally found in fruits such as watermelons, pears and grapes, but has since been processed as a food additive used to sweeten and enhance the flavor of foods, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
According to Cleveland Clinic researchers, erythritol is produced through fermenting corn.

A previous study on erythritol from researchers at Cleveland Clinic found that higher levels of erythritol were found among patients who experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event -- which includes stroke, heart attack, blood clots and cardiovascular death -- over three years of observation.
Last year, the World Health Organization issued a new recommendation that people who are trying to lose weight should avoid using zero-calorie non-sugar sweeteners.
Zero-calorie non-sugar sweeteners have not been shown to help with weight loss long-term in children or adults, and their use may bring side effects like increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, Type 2 diabetes and death in adults, the WHO said at the time.

2024-08-09,How the marine ecosystem in Maui is faring 1 year after the wildfires,Scientists still don't understand the full extent of the damage the Maui wildfires did to the corals and marine ecosystem off the west coast of the island.,"Scientists say they still don't understand the full extent of the damage the Maui wildfires did to the corals and marine ecosystem off the west coast of the island.
After an initial blaze sparked into a weeklong series of wildfires, the needs of those on land -- resulting from at least 100 people dead or missing as well as entire neighborhoods obliterated -- remained the priority in the months following, leaving little resources left to monitor the marine environment, researchers told ABC News.
""We almost felt like it was even inappropriate at first to talk about the research we were doing, just because there was so much pain on our island,"" Liz Yannell, program manager at Hui O Ka Wai Ola, a citizen science network based in Maui, told ABC News.

The immediate concern for the coastlines was the debris that was washing into the water offshore, as well as any ash and other toxins that affect air and water quality being carried by the smoke, John Starmer, science director at the Maui Nui Marine Resource Council, told ABC News. In addition, the boats that sank were leaking fuel and other chemicals into the Pacific Ocean.

The murky water appeared so precarious that ""nobody wanted to get in"" to examine it, Starmer said.
""It was difficult to really get a sense of what the conditions were,"" he said.
Researchers initially used a remotely operated vehicle and artificial intelligence to map the reefs off the coastline. Once there was less fear about contamination levels in the water, researchers began to conduct dive surveys. They have been testing the water quality for a suite of samples for metals and other general water quality parameters, like nutrients, Andrea Kealoha, assistant professor in the Department of Oceanography at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, told ABC News.

It was clear from the onset of the fire recovery that the cleanup efforts would be long, difficult and arduous and that the wildfires would have lasting environmental impacts on the island.

When the fires struck, environmental advocates feared the first big rain that would come in the wet season -- typically in November, which would have been just three months after the wildfires, Yannell said.
But mother nature was on Maui's side this time, with the ""first flush"" not occurring until Jan. 10, giving crews much more time to clear piles of debris, she added.
Still, despite the delayed rains, massive plumes of sediment washed over the reefs in the runoff when the first big storm moved through, Starmer said.

Researchers say they have found metals in the water -- such as copper, which is often used to prevent barnacles from growing on boats.
Despite the widespread devastation and the gargantuan cleanup mission, there is no evidence that the corals or marine ecosystem as a whole in West Maui were physically damaged as a result of the fire, the researchers said.

Visually, there are no impacts, Kealoha said.
""That doesn't mean that we're out of the woods yet,"" Starmer said.
MORE: Why climate change can't be blamed entirely for the Maui wildfires
The Scripps Institution of Oceanography has established a monitoring site in Launiupoko, just south of Lahaina and adjacent to the dump site where they are putting the wildfire debris, following concern expressed in the local community about contamination from that dump impacting the nearby reefs at Launiupoko and Olowalu, the marine research institution announced last week.
Researchers cautioned against conflating the current lack of evidence with the possibility that the marine ecosystem in West Maui were left unscathed by the wildfires in the longterm.
Continued testing is starting to present evidence that there is chemical pollution and other residual environmental consequences of the fires, Starmer said. The toxins are likely bioaccumulating and moving up the food chain, with some fish testing positive for PCBs and PAHs -- industrial chemicals -- he added.

Complicating monitoring efforts is the fact that wildfires -- especially urban fires than contain man-made chemicals -- rarely occur near reef systems. Therefore, the researchers don't know what to expect. They barely know what they're looking for, they said.
""There's not any substantial research that was easy to find about urban fires next to coastal waters and what that means for a coral reef ecosystem that's already so delicate and already struggling,"" Yannell said.
MORE: The perfect storm of weather conditions that led to the devastating wildfires in Maui
Globally, coral reef systems are struggling due to stressors like pollution and increasing ocean temperatures. Overall, the longterm health of the marine ecosystem in West Maui is unclear, and marine researchers will continue their quest to understand how the corals were affected and attempt to prevent runoff contaminated with toxins from rushing into the ocean.
But signs of a recovering marine ecosystem are present. The humpback whales have returned to the region on their annual migration routes, monk seals have taken up residence on their favorite beaches and crabs have reclaimed their favorite spots along the shore, Yannell said.

One of the silver linings of the wildfire aftermath is the reefs have ""had a break from people,"" such as tourists and surfers, similarly to what happened during the isolation measures of the COVID-19 pandemic, Kealoha said.
""While the world above water has completely changed, the reefs look fairly healthy and comparable to pre-fire coral cover data,"" Orion McCarthy, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said in a statement. ""It's still too early to say there is no impact.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-08-07,Silicon Valley leaders get behind Kamala Harris,"After several of its brightest stars declared support for former President Donald Trump, Silicon Valley has now come out in force for Vice President Kamala Harris.","After several of its brightest stars declared support for former President Donald Trump last month, Silicon Valley has now come out in force for Vice President Kamala Harris.
Though Silicon Valley remains a stronghold of support for Democrats, the Biden's administration's hawkish approach to tech has alienated many in the industry, and in recent months a number of high-profile entrepreneurs and investors including Elon Musk have backed Trump. But Harris, a Bay Area native with ties to the industry, could forge a stronger relationship with the Valley and has already received pledges of support from a new group called VCs for Harris -- representing hundreds of prominent venture capitalists.
Leslie Feinzaig, the venture capitalist who started VCs for Harris, said she recently wrote a pledge and bought a URL to host its site without expecting much.

Within days, billionaire entrepreneur and television personality Mark Cuban and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman joined the group.
""I basically haven't slept since,"" Feinzaig said.

Feinzaig's efforts have resulted in more than 700 pledges of support for Harris, and could signal a friendlier relationship between the vice president and the Valley than Biden has had.
""Silicon Valley had no friends in Washington during the Biden administration,"" said Georgetown Law Center professor and technology regulation expert Anupam Chander. ""You have the Department of Justice, which has filed those antitrust lawsuits. You have the White House and the U.S. Trade Representative, who have been retreating from efforts to ensure free flow of data across the world.""
And, of course, Chander said, you have Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, who has gained an army of fans -- and detractors -- for leading an ambitious effort to regulate giants such as Amazon and Meta.

The Biden administration did, however, work to pass the CHIPS Act, which allocated billions to onshore the production of semiconductors used in many electronics -- an achievement celebrated by the leading tech industry advocacy group as ""a major victory.""
Still, leading venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the co-founders of investment fund Andreessen Horowitz, cited concerns about Biden's policies in a podcast episode announcing their support for Trump.
""The future of our business, the future of technology, new technology and the future of America is literally at stake,"" Horowitz said.

Despite continuing frustrations with the Biden administration, according to industry insiders, Democrats appear to retain the support of most in Silicon Valley.
""Many of us are frustrated with Biden administration's sort of anti-technology, anti-business stance,"" said Silicon Valley investor and entrepreneur Merci Grace.
Grace said voting against Trump would be ""pretty easy"" for her and most of her peers, 70 or 80 percent of whom she estimates will ultimately support Harris.
Feinzaig said some of the high-profile figures in the industry who have come out in support of Trump ""weren't speaking for the full industry.""

Still, Trump has made inroads in certain corners of Silicon Valley. In June, a fundraiser hosted by tech billionaire David Sacks in coordination with Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance -- a former venture capitalist with ties to another prominent conservative tech mogul, Peter Thiel -- raised $12 million for the former president's campaign.
Trump has also received endorsements from a number of prominent entrepreneurs in the cryptocurrency sector, promising in his 2024 platform to ""end Democrats' unlawful and unAmerican Crypto crackdown."" Also, he spoke at the annual Bitcoin Conference in late July.
The former president has taken a stern stance on big tech companies, calling them ""too big"" and ""too powerful"" in a July interview with Bloomberg, but saying ""I don't want to destroy them.""
Some expect Harris, meanwhile, to assuage concerns in the Valley by taking a more dovish approach than the Biden administration, though they say her policy views on tech remain an open question.
""I would expect to return to a more technocratic stance,"" said Rob Merges, a law professor at U.C. Berkeley who spent several decades working in the tech industry. ""A traditional Clinton, Obama -- you know, friendly to the benefits of technology, reasonable in regulation, and cautious to not go too far in any one direction.""
Chander said he thinks Harris is ""someone who recognizes the importance of innovation, but also worries about some of the harms that might follow.""

But, he noted, ""because Harris didn't go through a regular primary, we haven't seen her stake out positions on some issues.""
Since Biden announced he would not seek reelection on July 21, Harris has not mentioned the tech industry in public campaign remarks and her campaign declined to comment on whether she would keep Khan at the head of the FTC (high-profile donors including Hoffman have recently urged her to do the reverse).
But the Valley needs no introduction to the vice president.
Harris dealt with the tech industry as California's attorney general and has headed some of the Biden administration's efforts surrounding artificial intelligence, working with top AI companies to agree on voluntary guidelines for the responsible use of generative AI. The vice president's brother-in-law, Tony West, also serves as chief legal officer for Uber, headquartered in San Francisco. In remarks about AI in November, she said she and Biden ""reject the false choice that suggests we can either protect the public or advance innovation.""
Grace said she gets the sense that Harris is ""a reasonable person who is very intelligent, and we can have a discussion with her."" She added that Trump ""is just someone who you can't trust.""
""It's not worth the temporary alignment to make a little bit more money on top of the billions that you already have -- to get in bed with someone who you can't trust,"" Grace said.
Feinzaig also shared her trust in Harris.
""I feel like we have a candidate that is listening.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-08-06,Markets rebound overnight after global sell-off,ABC News’ Chief Business Correspondent Rebecca Jarvis breaks down what to know about the stock market after a global selloff on Monday sparked new fears about an economic slowdown.,"Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-08-02,Elon Musk is taking a larger role in the election. Can he influence voters?,Musk endorsed Trump last month.,"Less than a week after Elon Musk publicly endorsed the candidacy of former President Donald Trump, he shared an edited video of Vice President Kamala Harris that used artificial intelligence to mimic her voice.
Musk, the wealthiest person in the world, spread the video on his social media platform X, where he boasts 192 million followers. The post appeared to violate X policies that disallow sharing ""synthetic, manipulated or out-of-context media."" Later, Musk defended the video as parody, which is permitted on the platform when adequately labeled.
A similar firestorm broke out this week after X suspended an account affiliated with a fundraising drive in support of Harris called ""White Dudes for Kamala.""
A message from X indicated that the account had been suspended for ""violating our rules against evading suspension,"" according to a screenshot posted by an event organizer. X, which plays host to nearly 250 million users, later reinstated the account.

The incidents stoked concern among some experts about the potential for Musk to wield X as a means of influencing public conversation about an election in which he holds a clear preference.
""It’s an unsettling situation,"" Paul Barrett, a professor at New York University Law School and deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, told ABC News. ""It illustrates the power that can reside in the hands of a single individual because of the almost bizarre way our current communications architecture is structured.""
Some experts disagreed, however, saying critics lack evidence of Musk’s undue intervention at X. They also downplayed the role X plays in the wider political conversation, noting that a focus on the platform risks overstating Musk’s influence.
""I actually don’t think his ownership of Twitter or activities on Twitter make the slightest bit of difference,"" Siva Vaidyanathan, professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, told ABC News, referring to the platform by its former name.
X did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. The request also sought comment from Musk.
When Musk acquired Twitter in 2022, he vowed to relax content moderation and turn the platform into a ""digital town square."" The company cut more than half of its staff, eased restrictions on some forms of speech and reinstated an account belonging to Trump, among other changes.
Meanwhile, Musk’s follower count soared. When he acquired Twitter, Musk had about 110 million followers. After adding more than 80 million followers, Musk has far surpassed the followings of top users like former President Barack Obama and pop star Justin Bieber.
In some cases, Musk has posted and amplified misinformation on X, including a post in January that falsely claimed a dependence on mail-in ballots would lead to a ""rigged election.""
""As the owner of Twitter, he’s the person who’s supposed to police the content but he himself is engaging in the spread of fake information,"" Hamed Qahri-Saremi, a professor of computer information systems at Colorado State University who studies social media, told ABC News.

After easing content moderation, the platform has come to rely on Community Notes, a system in which context is appended to false or misleading posts once it receives approval from a sufficient number of users. That system has proven inconsistent, however, allowing some false posts to spread widely without corrections, The New York Times reported last week.
Sam Woolley, a professor at the University of Texas School of Journalism who focuses on political communication and technology, said Musk’s commitment to free speech has fallen short in recent cases, for instance the temporary suspension of the account affiliated with ""White Dudes for Harris.""
""Musk’s actions suggest serious contradictions with his stated free speech intentions on the platform,"" Woolley told ABC News.
Some experts sharply disagreed with criticism of Musk regarding his oversight of X, saying he hasn’t interfered with the platform in a manner that suggests an intent to reward his political allies or punish his foes.
""Has Elon come out and specifically set a policy or rule for X that in turn would then say he’s abusing that power?"" asked Jason Buckweitz, a professor of business at Columbia University who studies the digital economy. ""I haven’t seen any evidence.""
""I don’t necessarily think it’s a concern unless there’s some level of negative influence,"" Buckweitz added.
Plus, observers should not assume that Musk’s large follower count translates into immense impact, said Vaidyanathan, noting that some of the followers are likely bots and inactive users.
""The very exposure to or posting of something doesn't mean that anybody saw it or believed it,"" Vaidyanathan said. Many of the followers are likely supporters of Musk who would already back his preferred candidate anyway, he added.
For his part, Vaidyanathan said Musk still wields significant political influence as the owner of aerospace company Space X, which has current contracts with the U.S. government.
MORE: Where do Trump and Harris stand on cryptocurrency?
Joshua Tucker, director of the Center for Social Media and Politics at New York University, said Musk's dual role as an owner and user of X raises a policy question surrounding the regulation of social media platforms.
Tucker, who declined to say whether X warrants government regulation, pointed to a law calling for the ban or sale of TikTok as an example of the federal government weighing in on social media. On Wednesday, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation that aims to protect children's safety on social media, signaling further willingness to police the platforms.
""We continue to live in an era where we have to think very carefully as a country about what types of public policies to regulate the behavior of social media companies in terms of public health but also the information ecosystem,"" Tucker said.
Speaking about Musk's dual role on X, Tucker added: ""If this is something the public finds objectionable, that's ultimately a public policy question.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 1945, the United Nations has addressed issues that transcend borders, with the world's problems being debated at the General Assembly Building in New York.
Francis, a diplomat from the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago, has served as his country's permanent representative to the United Nations since 2021. He was elected to serve as the UN General Assembly’s 78th president in 2023.
President of the 78th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Ambassador Dennis Francis gives an interview on July 3, 2024, in Kyiv, Ukraine.

ABC News talked to Francis at the General Assembly Building's iconic hall about Israel and Palestine, Ukraine and Russia, climate change, South Sudan and his message to the next president of the United States.
ABC NEWS: Every president probably has had their own tumult.
FRANCIS: Yes.
ABC NEWS: But it just feels like on your watch, it's especially busy. But do you feel that?
FRANCIS: Yes, I do. Folks who have been here for quite some time say they’ve never really seen it quite like this before. So many challenges emerging at the same time; peace and stability is under increased duress. I think there are 55 conflict situations in the world. 55.
ABC NEWS: The UN Security Council approved a ceasefire plan that was backed by the United States. And in the meantime, we've seen no change from Hamas or Israel. Does the Security Council have sufficient power?
FRANCIS: The question is power over whom? As critical as Hamas is as a player in the Middle East crisis, Hamas is not a state. The General Assembly, for example, had called long ago, in October of 2023, for a complete ceasefire in Gaza. We cannot police the world. The UN doesn't have a police force. The UN speaks and tries to change behavior through its positions and principles, its values.
I would like to see, and I think the only one that is really credible, a two-state solution. Where Israel and the Palestinians live side by side in peace and security.
We’ve had wars in the Middle East, between the two sides, repeatedly. Are we going to continue this cycle of death, degradation, pain, suffering indefinitely?
ABC NEWS: UN-backed groups believe that maybe as many as 500,000 Palestinians are on the verge of famine. Do you think enough is being done to provide relief and aid to the Palestinians?
FRANCIS: We, as the UN, have a concern that more can and ought to be done. We've watched the people of Palestine suffer in the most heartrending way. And the hope is that those who have the capacity and the power to make a difference, in terms of the delivery of aid and support to those people, will step up and do the honorable thing, consistent with the requirements of international human rights and humanitarian law.
ABC NEWS: You mentioned that there are currently 55 conflicts going on globally.
FRANCIS: Yes.
ABC NEWS: Of course, top of mind: the war in Ukraine, which is now in excess of two years. What do you see as the likely outcome there and the responsibility of the UN?
FRANCIS: What really needs to happen is that the Russian forces need to pull back and remove themselves from the territory of Ukraine. That is the only credible outcome insofar as we at the United Nations are concerned.
ABC NEWS: Do you feel that Russia should have a permanent spot on the UN Security Council with veto power?
FRANCIS: That's not a decision for me. That's a decision for the membership of the United Nations.
ABC NEWS: But if it were up to you?
FRANCIS: It isn't up to me because the president does not have those powers
ABC NEWS: I know you recently returned from Namibia. Namibia and Africa, in general, both extremely vulnerable to climate change.
FRANCIS: Yes.
ABC NEWS: And I'm wondering if you are concerned, with regard to the UN secretary general has described this as a highway to hell, that this is a moment of truth.
FRANCIS: I normally wear a pin, and for some reason today I forgot it. It’s a 1.5 degree pin. That's the temperature at which we need to keep the increase in global temperature above pre-industrial levels. That is important, because for a number of countries in the global south, particularly small island developing states, low lying coastal areas, anything above that would be utterly cataclysmic.

ABC NEWS: Let's talk about South Sudan. There are reports that 25 million people are in need of aid, famine is looming, 8 million people have been displaced from their homes. Do you feel that the world is paying enough attention to the atrocities going on there?
FRANCIS: No.
ABC NEWS: And why do you think that is?
FRANCIS: Insufficient attention has been paid to the conflicts in Africa and, in particular, what's going on in South Sudan. It is in a very desperate situation. And I would urge, I would urge the international development community to pay greater attention and to be more forthcoming in the context of humanitarian aid. Not just for South Sudan, but there are other places as well, for Somalia, Mali, other places, because human suffering is going on at an alarming rate. And those of us who have the capacity to do something about it need to act.
ABC NEWS: How do you feel that the outcome of America's presidential election in November will impact the UN?
FRANCIS: The UN does not have a political preference for governments. So whomsoever occupies the Oval Office come November, I'm sure the UN will be in a position to interact with, discuss policy with, and come to decisions that are in the best interests of the world in general.
ABC NEWS: Do you have a message for the future president of the United States?
FRANCIS: Let's join together and take some bold decisions, bold decisions to begin in earnest to repair some of the problems that are daunting us in the international society – climate change, sea level rise, antimicrobial resistance, artificial intelligence. Ensuring that we harvest the best benefits that can advance science and advance human society without necessarily importing the risks and threats that could unravel the social fabric of society.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-07-30,Homeland Security Investigations sees 300% increase in foreign victims of sextortion,Homeland Security Investigations sees 300% increase in foreign victims of sextortion,"Homeland Security Investigations has seen a 300% increase in foreign victims of financial sextortion, according to the head of the center that investigates cybercrimes at the Department of Homeland Security.
""We have seen an 86% drop in domestic victims of financial sextortion since that time, unfortunately, what we've seen is almost 300% increase in foreign victims of financial sextortion,"" Mike Prado the head of HSI's Cyber Crime Center told ABC News.
Sextortion is when a victim sends explicit material to a scammer and then is threatened with public posting unless they pay the scammer money.
The HSI Cyber Crimes Center focuses on all things cyber – but they primarily focus on online child sexual exploitation, according to Prado.
""The threat that we talk about has evolved so rapidly from even a few years ago that we're deploying new tools, new techniques, new proactive measures and new preemptive strategies to try to combat the continued prevalence of online child sexual exploitation and abuse,"" Prado said.

The two most prevalent areas that sextortion scams take place is in the Ivory Coast and in Nigeria, according to Prado. Homeland Security Investigations has an agent detailed to the Ivory Coast to work with local authorities due to the non-extradition rules they have.

Prado added the scams are not sexual in nature, but just look to get money from victims.
Working to end child sexual abuse
Criminals who want to abuse children are attempting to get children off social media platforms and onto encrypted apps, outside the eyes of law enforcement, according to Prado.
""Everywhere children are congregating online, predators are aware of that and then taking them off platform into other more encrypted chat rooms and areas where they can have encrypted conversations outside the eyes of law enforcement and outside the lot, outside the eyes of the tech industry and abusing these abusing these children,"" he said.

Predators, he said, ""stop at nothing"" to abuse a child.
There has also been an unpick in the use of artificial intelligence to create images using children who haven't been the victim of abuse.
""It is probably the most concerning emergent threat that is now a reality that our agents are dealing with on a daily basis out in the field, and that our agents at the cyber-crime center are dealing with on a daily basis,"" he said. ""This generative AI problem is going to exponentially grow the number of images that our agents are having to sift through to determine if a child has actually been directly abused or indirectly abused through the use of generative AI.""
To stop online predators, HSI deploys agents in 200 field offices around the country, and 93 foreign offices in 73 counties.
""These cases are tremendously important to us,"" he said."" I want to continue to make it a priority that these cases be worked as expeditiously as possible.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-07-26,Doctors implant artificial heart in patient awaiting transplant,"A 57-year-old in Texas, who is waiting for a heart transplant, had the bottom half of his heart removed and replaced with an artificial device.","Nearly 12 years ago, Jessie Owen's life changed forever.
""My family was going over a mountain pass and a tree fell on our car. In that moment, my parents passed away, my siblings were severely injured, and I became quadriplegic,"" Owen said. ""I lost my independence. I lost my job. I lost my apartment. I lost my autonomy and the life that I dreamed for myself.""
Like Owen, more than 300,000 people live with spinal cord injuries in the United States, with an estimated 18,000 new cases each year, data shows.
Motor vehicle accidents account for the majority of spinal cord injuries and are closely followed by falls, acts of violence and sports activities, according to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center.
Jessie Owen was left paralyzed nearly 12 years ago when a tree fell on a car in which she was a passenger.

For years, options for recovery have been limited, but a newly FDA-cleared external spinal stimulator, ARC-EX Therapy, which received clearance on Dec. 19, may offer hope for people like Owen.
""ARC-EX is simply electrodes attached to skin on the back of the neck,"" explained Chet Moritz, Ph.D., a professor of rehabilitation medicine at the University of Washington. ""It allows us to pass current through the skin to activate the sensory nerves as they enter the spinal cord. Now, those sensory nerves make direct connections to the motor nerves which help people to move.""

Owen, who participated in the Up-LIFT study, a clinical trial focusing on the health benefits of ARC-EX Therapy, saw a life-changing impact.

The Up-LIFT study produced promising results.
Of the 60 patients with cervical spinal cord injuries studied, 72% saw improvements in hand strength and function. Participants also reported fewer muscle spasms, better sleep, less pain, and improved independence during daily activities.
""The success of [this] study of people with spinal cord injuries is phenomenal,"" noted Moritz. ""There are essentially no current therapies for chronic spinal cord injury, and so having the majority of patients respond in both strength and function measures [is] just an outstanding result.""

With FDA approval, ARC-EX Therapy is expected to become more accessible.
""Patients can work with their local rehabilitation clinics to see a therapist and work with them in the clinic at first to tune the device,"" Moritz said. Results may appear quickly -- some participants noticed changes within just a few sessions, he added.
While the device is currently cleared for improving hand strength, function and sensation, Moritz noted other benefits: ""Some people will have modest improvements in their bladder function, heart rate, or blood pressure control.""
Leah Croll, M.D., vascular neurologist at Maimonides Health and assistant professor of neurology at SUNY Downstate, shared the excitement over the device.
""The idea that ARC-EX Therapy may accelerate or augment neurologic recovery is really exciting. Any improvement in neurologic function is meaningful and has far-reaching impact in the daily lives of these patients and their families,"" she said.
The road to recovery after a spinal cord injury is grueling, Croll said.
""After emergency and ICU care is completed, the mainstay of treatment is working closely with physical therapists, occupational therapists and other rehabilitation professionals to support neurologic recovery,"" said Croll. ""Patients may also need medications and certain procedures, depending on their unique symptoms.""
For Owen and others, ARC-EX Therapy represents a renewed sense of hope and an exciting change in the way these patients can be treated.
""[With ARC-EX Therapy], I continued to gain function back, and I found I was able to pour more into other people,"" Owen said. ""The first indicator of success that I noticed was my own happiness. It works, and it gives us hope and passion.""

2024-07-25,"Election officials continue to face threats, harassment ahead of November",Election workers ABC News spoke with say the threats against them that began after the 2020 election have not slowed down.,"In early July, a man wearing a gator face mask, sunglasses, and camera equipment attached to a vest walked into the elections building in King County, Washington, and began to take videos and photos of the employees and their surroundings.
The man, according to a video obtained by ABC News, approached a counter and began harassing the election workers as he recorded them with his equipment.
After he left, the man posted a video of the interaction on YouTube and published some of the staff's names, emails, and phone numbers, which officials said resulted in ""dozens of calls and emails"" to election workers.
MORE: The top threats facing the 2024 election
The incident, which left King County employees feeling uneasy, is an example of the ongoing harassment and threats election workers are facing as they prepare for November's election.
Experts and election workers say the threats began after baseless claims of election fraud proliferated following the 2020 election, and they have not slowed down. And with the potential misuse of artificial intelligence and the threat of deadly opioids being mailed to election offices, election workers ABC News spoke with said they are feeling even more unnerved.
The concerns from election workers come months after former Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss won a $148 million judgment after a judge found former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani guilty of defaming them. In an interview with ABC News' Terry Moran in 2022, the mother and daughter described how threats of violence, both online and in person, temporarily drove Freeman from her home and drove them both from their work as election officers.
""Election workers are still dealing with a lot of lies that are being told about the elections, and are in many ways bearing the kind of the consequences of those lies with harassment, abuse and sometimes threats,"" said Lawrence Norden, senior director of the Elections and Government Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a bipartisan public policy think tank.
Stocking up on Narcan
Last August, when King County received an envelope with a suspicious substance in the mail, it also came with an unsettling message: ""Enjoy some complimentary WHITE POWDER! Not saying what it is but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ASKING AROUND FOR A NARCAN!""
A photo shows a letter containing traces of fentanyl that was received by King County, Washington, officials in August, 2024.

""There must be: NO MORE ELECTIONS!"" the letter said.
After law enforcement confirmed the envelope contained traces of fentanyl, election officials in the county implemented robust safety protocols and stocked up on Narcan -- a drug that's sprayed directly into the nostrils of someone experiencing an overdose by touching or inhaling an opioid, which blocks the effects of opioids and can quickly restore breathing.
Two months later, the county was targeted again with another letter in an envelope that was also laced with the deadly opioid.
""It was terrifying,"" said Julie Wise, the director of elections for King County.
After election offices in four other states received envelopes with fentanyl and other dangerous substances last year, election workers added Narcan to the safety measures they're implementing heading into the election.
In Washoe County, Nevada, interim registrar of voters Cari Anne Burgess told ABC News the county has 35 kits of Narcan.
""We absolutely have our Narcan kits,"" Burgess said. ""We've all been trained on it and we've also been trained on 'Stop the Bleed.'""
""Fentanyl is of big concern these days,"" said Josh Zygielbaum, the clerk and recorder for Adams County, Colorado. ""We now have Narcan everywhere, and have changed our mail-opening processes due to some concerns that we could be a target for potential biological or chemical threat.""
Zygielbaum said that since the 2020 election, he has worn a bulletproof vest to work every day -- an extreme measure he felt he had to take to feel safe.
""It's sad, but I love what I do,"" Zygielbaum said. ""Without having safe and secure elections, we don't have a democracy. And so it really is the front line of the fight to preserve democracy.""
Fighting the threat of AI
While election officials work to combat physical threats, experts say artificial intelligence could potentially pose an even greater danger to the electoral process.
In January, AI-generated robocalls that appeared to impersonate the voice of President Joe Biden targeted voters in New Hampshire to discourage them from voting in the primary.
""The threat from AI is potentially a change in the degree of what [election workers] have seen before,"" Norden from the Brennan Center told ABC News.
Zygielbaum, who said he is increasingly concerned about AI, said his county has been working with local schools that have STEM programs to learn more about the technology and how to make voters more aware of its dangers.
In King County, Wise told ABC News that AI has been a boon to the county's election operation -- but she's still concerned about its misuse.
""AI has allowed us to save at least $100,000 in taxpayer dollars to use towards translation services,"" Wise said. ""So there's certainly pros and cons to this technology and it's definitely been a big conversation in the election community nationwide.""
MORE: DHS warns of threats to election posed by artificial intelligence
At the same time, Wise, said, ""We're poised really well to react to any mis- or disinformation that can result from AI.""
Wise and other officials told ABC News that the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is working with election workers across the country to teach them about AI and how to identify potential threats and disinformation created with the technology.
According to a report from the Brennan Center, AI has the potential to threaten election security not only by more effectively spreading disinformation, but also by more easily exploiting cyber vulnerabilities in election systems.
""The misinformation, the threats, the attempts to intimidate election officials -- that all existed before,"" said Norden. ""It's just that now, AI makes it easier to do at a larger scale and in a more sophisticated way.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-07-25,Early humans likely prompted the demise of woolly mammoths and other ancient species: Study,"Early humans may have played a significant role in the demise of one of the most iconic ancient species -- the woolly mammoth -- and others like it, scientists say.","Early humans may have played a significant role in the demise of one of the most iconic ancient species -- the woolly mammoth -- and others like it, according to new research.
The arrival of early, primitive humans on Earth during the Pleistocene period, roughly 1.8 million years ago, caused a five-fold increase in extinction rates of proboscidean species, a taxonomic order of afrotherian mammals that include only one living family -- modern elephants -- and several extinct species, including the woolly mammoth, according to a paper published Wednesday in Science.

Once homo sapiens, or modern humans, arrived on the planet about 129,000 years ago, the extinction rates of proboscidean species increased drastically -- by 17-fold, the researchers say they found while modeling fossil records with artificial intelligence.
Since the emergence of early humans and modern humans, about 27 proboscidean species have gone extinct, Torsten Hauffe, an ecologist at the University of Fribourg and Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and co-author of the study, told ABC News.

The model considered human interactions, including the arrival of early humans, with the findings pointing to human activity ""very strongly"" affecting proboscidean extinctions, according to the study.
Hunting of proboscidean species was likely one of the main drivers of population declines and eventually extinction, Juan Cantalapiedra, an evolutionary paleobiologist at the National Museum of Natural Sciences in Madrid and co-author of the paper, told ABC News.

Records dating back 400,000 years ago shows evidence that Neanderthals scarfed on meat and extracted bones from proboscideans, Hauffe said.
They hunted other groups of mammals, such as carnivores, Daniele Silvestro, a biologist at the University of Fribourg and co-author of the study, told ABC News.
""And these are species that usually would not have predators, because they are the predators,"" he said.

The research also pointed to higher temperatures associated with the arrival of early humans, Hauffe said. The declines also coincide with warming phase following a ""strong"" Ice Age, but those temperature changes were relatively minor compared to the other factors, he added.
The findings of the paper indicate a long-lasting detrimental anthropogenic, or human-caused, effect on biodiversity, the researchers said.

Hunting and major disruptions to ecosystems have the potential to impact species declines in modern times, Cantalapiedra said. It occurred in 2019, when the bush fires in Australia wiped out billons of animals and decimated koala populations.
Human-caused climate change and development leading to loss of habitat are among the biggest culprits in causing the decline of certain species, the researchers said.
""Biodiversity today is experiencing a magnitude of change or loss that has not been seen really in the recent past,"" Silvestro said. When timber is cut down, is affects the fauna, fungi and species ranging from insects to amphibians, he added.

Dietary adaptation and flexibility was likely also a driver of speciation, especially near the end of the Neogene period about 3 million years ago, as was geographic distribution and dental morphologies, the authors said.
While fossil records hold clues on how speciation and extinction have influenced ecosystem turnover throughout millennia, the impacts proved difficult to model before the emergence of AI, the researchers sad.

The researchers used pre-existing information on 2,118 fossils belonging to 175 proboscidean species that lived from 35 million years ago to 10,000 years ago to feed into the model, according to the paper.
Before AI existed, previous modeling attempts only incorporated single predictors, such as one environmental change or the acquisition of a single trait, which do not reflect the multi-faceted nature of evolution, the authors said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-07-24,'I love you robo-dad': Meet a family using AI to preserve loved ones after death,"The product is part of a burgeoning AI industry centered on ""grief tech.""","Once a week, 9-year-old Jayce Gowin and his dad sit down at their living room table to discuss anything from a favorite flavor of Cheetos to life advice. But Jayce doesn't talk to his dad -- instead he interacts with an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot trained to mimic his father.
Jayce sits next to his real-life dad, Jason Gowin, who types questions into a laptop on behalf of Jayce, before the two of them await an audio response from the AI. Gowin said he sought out the technology after serious health scares left him and his wife concerned about leaving Jayce and his young siblings parentless.
On a Sunday morning last month, Jayce wanted to know whether the bot remembered his favorite stuffed animal, Bob.
""Yes, Jayce,"" the AI uttered in a voice meant to closely resemble his father's. ""Bob is a mouse character in your bedtime stories. We've talked about him before and how he has a voice.""
Jayce was thrilled. ""I love you robo-dad,"" he said.

The members of the Gowin family volunteered to test the product made by a startup called You, Only Virtual, in exchange for permanent access free of charge. The firm is one of a handful of companies in a burgeoning industry centered on so-called ""grief tech,"" chatbots modeled off of deceased loved ones.
Jason Gowin and his wife, Melissa, decided to build AI chatbots modeled on themselves after each of them experienced a serious health scare.
ABC News/Katherine Caulderwood, Nam Cho and Lilia Geho
The products aim to redefine how some people deal with grief, offering users a chance to carry on conversations with loved ones long after they die. Proponents hold up the once-unfathomable technology as an emblem of the transformative benefits promised by AI.
Critics, however, raise concerns about the privacy of data shared by users and the technical feasibility of a bot that accurately speaks with the voice of a dead relative. Some products in the sector simply repeat statements recorded by a loved one prior to his or her death; others voice original statements, including the product used by the Gowin family.
Generative AI tools like ChatGPT -- which scan text from across the internet and string words together based on statistical probability -- have displayed a propensity to share arbitrary, false or hateful speech, raising alarm about the personal and societal effects of noxious words delivered with the intimacy and authority of a deceased loved one.
""There's a real need for many people to have an interaction that they can't have,"" Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor at New York University and author of the book ''Rebooting AI,"" told ABC News. ""Loneliness is a real problem. Grief can be very challenging.""
""In some sense, everybody who's using it now is part of an experiment and not a very well-controlled experiment,"" Marcus added. ""The more people you have in that, the more you have to worry about: What are the consequences?""
Jason and his wife, Melissa Gowin -- who live with their three children in the small town of Sayre, Pennsylvania -- turned to grief tech after each of them suffered brush with death.
In 2019, Melissa Gowin had a stroke days after giving birth to twin boys, the couple said. Soon afterward, a doctor told her she had as little as two years left to live, they added.
Four months later, Jason Gowin was diagnosed with an early stage of stomach cancer, putting his health in doubt as well, they added. Suddenly, the couple had to reckon with the prospect of their young children growing up without parents.
""When you're in your 20s and 30s, you think you're invincible. This kind of thing is something you only hear about on the news, said Jason Gowin, a stand-up comedian and podcast host. ""Turns out those stories on the news happen to real people -- and it happened to us.""
While watching the Superman movie ""Man of Steel,"" the couple happened upon a way to address their difficult situation, as seen through the eyes of the main character.
""[Superman] goes into the Fortress of Solitude and talks to what is essentially an AI version of his father,"" Jason Gowin recounted. ""I said, 'You know what, I bet somebody has come up with this technology.'""
Jayce Gowin, 9, spends 30 minutes per week interacting with an AI chatbot based on his father, Jason.
ABC News/Katherine Caulderwood, Nam Cho and Lilia Geho
He said he found a website for the Los Angeles-based You, Only Virtual, and contacted its CEO, Justin Harrison.
""Talk about Americana: Mom, dad, three kids, house full of pets; some of the most loving, funny, just joyful people I've ever met,"" Harrison told ABC News about meeting the Gowin family. ""Then they told me their story.""
The company creates what it calls ""versonas,"" virtual reproductions of deceased loved ones that utter responses in conversation with a user either through written chats or audio that mimic a relative's voice.
Unlike some of its competitors, You, Only Virtual produces generative chatbots that craft original responses after scanning training materials, such as text messages, videos, and information about the deceased gleaned from previous conversations with users.
""It's very simple,"" Jason Gowin said. ""You take text messages, or video or audio clips, and you upload them into this portal. It gets turned into their algorithm that they have built for each personality.""
MORE: Senators unveil 'roadmap' for government-funded AI research, regulation
He acknowledged holding some concerns about data privacy but he said the family is careful to avoid putting sensitive information into the chatbot, such as financial or medical records. Otherwise, he said, the information is of a type he would share publicly anyway. ""We're a very open book,"" Jason Gowin said.
During a session speaking with the chatbot last month, Jayce wanted to know whether it remembered an old friend of his father's, named Mark. ""I'm not sure,"" the chatbot responded, using a voice that closely resembled Jason's. ""Can you remind me who Mark is?""
After being told a few details about Mark, the chatbot offered to share a story about him, as if it had taken part in the experience firsthand.
""I remember a time when Mark and I were on a road trip, and we got lost in the middle of nowhere,"" the chatbot said. ""We didn't have GPS or smartphones back then. So we had to rely on our sense of direction and find our way back to civilization.""
Sitting alongside his son, Jason Gowin called the story bogus. ""He just made that entirely up,"" he said. ""That's not a real thing.""
When asked about risks posed by false or misleading statements made by the chatbot under the guise of a trusted relative, Jason Gowin downplayed the mishaps as the sort of errors that he and other real-life parents make all the time.
""I don't know why we're going to hold the AI to any different standard,"" he added. ""As a parent, I've made major, major screw ups. And you don't see them as screw ups at the time.""
Some grief tech companies have sidestepped generative AI altogether.
Jason and Melissa Gowin spend time with their son, Jayce.
ABC News/Katherine Caulderwood, Nam Cho and Lilia Geho
StoryFile, another firm based in Los Angeles, offers an interactive version of deceased relatives by recording an hourslong question-and-answer session with the individual before his or her death, and in turn, attempting to create a reproduction that responds to prompts.
In this case, the virtual reproduction utters pre-recorded content in a real-life manner. If a topic falls outside a set of established discussion areas, however, the reproduction cannot respond.
Still, the company occasionally uses AI to make modifications of the source material, James Fong, the CEO of StoryFile, told ABC News. In some cases, the company adds transition sentences or combines two different responses provided by the deceased. Going further, the company made a digital recreation of Walmart founder Sam Walton through adapting performances of his words by a real-life actor.
The digital recreation of Walton was made for an exhibit at the Walmart Museum in Bentonville, Arkansas.
MORE: 'Overlooked' workers who train AI can face harsh conditions, advocates say
The company views the use of AI as allowable in cases ""where you're not infringing upon the authenticity,"" Fong said.
Grief tech fills a need for those who've lost a family member, but it also risks enabling a denial of that loss, Elena Lister, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College and co-author of the book ""Giving Hope: Conversations With Children About Illness, Death, and Loss.""
""People ache for this. They feel like, 'If I could just talk to this person.' They imagine conversations in their head,"" Lister told ABC News. ""The pain of loss can be great, especially for a child who loses a parent.""
""If you can accept, 'I'm not really talking to the mom that I long for -- it's a projected image,' then I think that helps things,"" Lister added. ""But that's very hard to do because our hunger to have that person with us again overrides our logical, cognitive knowledge.""
Harrison, of You, Only Virtual, admits the company does encounter discomfort among some people wary about the notion of recreating their deceased relatives in virtual form.
""I think it's pretty normal for people to feel uncomfortable with things that are new,"" Harrison said. ""This won't be for everybody, although I think it'll be for many, many more people than realize it.""
""Ultimately, we're a tool,"" he said. ""That's the cool thing about living in the world that we live in today: You can pick and choose what's out there.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

날짜 없음,Rob Manfred: MLB worried about threats to players from gambling,요약 없음,"ARLINGTON, Texas -- Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred expressed concern Tuesday for player safety as it relates to gambling while expressing confidence in the league's ability to catch personnel who violate the league's gambling policies.
Speaking hours before the All-Star Game, Manfred said he's heard from players about threats they are receiving -- though he didn't get into specifics about them.
""If a player receives a threat from any source, on any topic, it is a matter of concern to us that we take really seriously,"" Manfred stated. ""I've had players in the last month mention this issue to me as one of concern and we're discussing what we should do to be more proactive in this area.""
Manfred's comments come on the heels of several player suspensions this season and even a lifetime ban for gambling, combined with an umpire currently under investigation for a violation as well.
It also comes just weeks after  Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, pleaded guilty to bank and tax fraud charges after stealing money from Ohtani to pay off gambling debts.
Manfred is confident the league's association with gambling entities is helping police their policies. Those companies report violations to the league which can lead to investigations being opened and stiff penalties assessed. Last month, San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano was banned for life for gambling a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates last season. Four other players received one-year suspensions.
""I'm a believer that penalties and demonstration of your ability to figure what's going on serves as a deterrent,"" Manfred said. ""Working your whole life to get to the major leagues in whatever role and lose that over sports betting, that's a huge penalty.
""I truly believe we're in a better position to know what's going on today then we were in the old days when it was all illegal.""
Manfred also indicated that talks have gained some steam in regard to MLB players participating in the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028.
""We're talking about what can be done,"" Manfred said. ""What exactly what it would look like. What are the compromises that we would have to make in terms of our season. I remain open-minded on that topic.""
The league could take several different paths in order for players to participate including shortening the 2028 season by games or lengthening it by days or weeks. The league believes the schedule would have to pause for about 10 days -- taking the place of an All-Star break -- and would occur a little later than the normal mid-July break. The discussions are still in the early stages and could just apply to 2028 when the Olympics are in the United States.
""There is player interest on this topic,"" Manfred said.
Tony Clark, the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said that, ""The feedback we've gotten from players is such that there is an interest in participating if given the opportunity.""
Also, out of safety concerns because of excessive heat, the league is attempting to accommodate the Oakland Athletics and their opponents next season when the team plays its home games in Sacramento.
There is concern that temperatures could reach dangerous levels for players playing in what will be the only open air, artificial surface venue in MLB. Manfred said the goal is to play as many night games as possible there.
""We're trying to limit the distance that would have to be traveled by clubs from Sacramento on getaway days,"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,Colombia reach Copa América final with win over Uruguay,요약 없음,"James Rodríguez served up his sixth assist of the tournament to help 10-man Colombia beat Uruguay 1-0 in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Wednesday to set up a Copa América final against Argentina, before the night descended into chaos as players clashed with fans.
Argentina beat Canada 2-0 in the first semifinal on Tuesday to book their place in Sunday's final in Miami Gardens, Florida. 
Victory for Colombia on Wednesday meant they extended their unbeaten run to a team-record 28 games, dating back to a loss to Argentina in February 2022.
In a contentious match that included seven yellow cards and one red, players from both teams pushed and shoved in a scrum on the field at the final whistle. Darwin Núñez and about a dozen Uruguay teammates then  went into the stands as fans brawled. A video showed Núñez hitting a fan in Colombian team colours.
Jefferson Lerma scored the only goal in front of a fervent and overwhelmingly pro-Colombia crowd of 70,644 at Bank of America Stadium when he headed in a deep corner from James in the 39th minute.
James becomes the first South American player with six assists at a single major tournament since Pelé for Brazil at the 1970 World Cup.
Colombia's task of maintaining their advantage was complicated when defender Daniel Muñoz was sent off in first-half stoppage time after receiving a second yellow card for swinging an elbow at Uruguay's Manuel Ugarte. Muñoz received his first yellow card from Mexican referee César Ramos in the 31st minute for a reckless slide tackle on Maximiliano Araújo.
Liverpool striker Darwin Núñez failed to take advantage of multiple first-half opportunities, with Colombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas not having to make his first save until he stopped Nicolás de la Cruz's attempt in the 68th minute.
Substitute Luis Suárez, Uruguay's career leader with 68 goals, hit the outside of a post with a shot in the 71st as Uruguay struggled to find a breakthrough against the 10 men.
Colombia's Mateus Uribe, another second-half sub, put an open shot wide in the 88th, and Uribe's open shot in the fourth minute of stoppage time ricocheted off the body of sliding goalkeeper Sergio Rochet then the crossbar.
But one goal proved enough for Colombia to reach their third Copa América final and first since winning their only title as hosts in 2001.
After the game, videos showed Uruguay players wading into the stands to exchange blows with Colombia fans as police personnel tried to keep the two sides apart.
Uruguay captain Jose Maria Gimenez said the players were trying to defend their families.
""Let me say something before they cut you off because they won't let us speak into the microphone, they don't want me to say anything about what's going on but this is a disaster,"" Gimenez said on the official broadcast. ""Please be careful, our families are in the stands, there are little newborn babies. It was a disaster; there was no police and we had to defend our families.
Argentina are seeking a record 16th Copa América title and looking to join Spain as the only countries to win three straight major titles.
Wednesday's match was played in 90-degree heat on a surface that was converted from artificial turf to grass in the weeks leading up to the contest.
Uruguay will face  Canada in the third-place playoff on Saturday.

2024-07-02,A look at AI workout trainers,"With the technology growing in popularity, people are using it to create customized workouts. ABC News' Becky Worley tries out a few options on the market.","For one high school student in New Jersey, a single computer science competition fueled a mission to get more teenage girls interested in artificial intelligence, or AI.
Ishani Singh, now 17, was a freshman at High Technology High School in 2021 when she attended a state computer science competition, where she noticed she was only one of a few female students competing.
When Singh went onto compete in the regional competition, she said she was ""shocked"" to see that she was the only female student competing.
""I looked around and there were, like, zero girls, and I was like, 'OK,'"" Singh told ABC News in an interview airing on ""The Year: 2024,"" an annual special airing Dec. 26 on ABC. ""That felt a little weird.""
The experience inspired Singh, now a high school senior, to launch Girls Rule AI, which aims to empower young women to learn about AI, a term that, according to NASA, ""refers to computer systems that can perform complex tasks normally done by human-reasoning, decision making, creating, etc.""
Ishani Singh founded Girls Rule AI after attending a computer science competition where she was the only girl.
ABC News
Since the start of the organization nearly three years ago, Girls Rule AI has taught free courses on AI to over 200 girls in 25 states and six countries around the world, including Kenya and Afghanistan, according to Singh.
Gloria Mwangi, a Girls Rule AI instructor in Kenya, said she believes women working in AI-related fields could be transformative.
""In Kenya, the interest in tech and AI is definitely growing,"" Mwangi told ABC News. ""I think AI has a lot of potential to make a difference for young women here.""
Singh added that the success of her company, she believes, has been in making AI more accessible to more girls.

""I think it's just because girls are a little afraid to just start on this journey in the first place,"" Singh said of the gender difference in AI. ""So, I think by creating this community, I was able to make girls feel a little more more comfortable and just get them more confident in this field.""
Even with the progress, Singh said she feels there is a lot of work to do when it comes to getting girls interested in AI so they can go onto careers in the science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, industries.
According to the American Association of University Women, women currently make up 34% of the STEM workforce and are particularly outnumbered by men in fast-growing and high-paying fields like engineering and computer science.
""We're not at the level that we should be,"" Singh said. ""I think there should be more women in the tech field.""

Singh added that she believes the more young girls who become interested in AI, the greater the experience will be for all people who use the technology.
""If we have this growing surge of interest among girls and women in the field ... they'll be able to provide valuable input into the AI models that we're putting out into the world these days,"" she said. ""So, it's great to see that people have the same passion that I do.""

2024-07-02,Where is the stock market headed in the 2nd half of 2024?,The S&P 500 has climbed nearly 15% this year.,"The stock market defied expectations with a strong performance over the first half of 2024. But the success poses a key question for investors: Is there room for stocks to go even higher?
The S&P 500 climbed nearly 15% over the first six months of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed about 4% over that period, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq soared roughly 18%.
Analysts who spoke to ABC News attributed the strong gains to enthusiasm about artificial intelligence as well as resilient economic growth and expectations that interest rates would ease.
But, experts predicted, the stock market will likely struggle to sustain its breakneck growth over the remainder of the year as investors turn away from increasingly high prices and weather uncertainty centered on the economic outlook and the November election.

“It has been a very impressive start to the year,” Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, told ABC news. “But as we look toward the second half, on a short term basis, we think the market is overbought.”
Despite straining under the weight of the highest interest rates in two decades, the U.S. economy has sustained solid growth. Meanwhile, U.S job gains have remained robust, exceeding expectations and driving significant wage increases.
Progress, however, in the fight against inflation has largely stalled. Even so, the Fed has indicated that an additional rate increase is unlikely, instead forecasting one rate cut by the end of 2024.
“The markets have welcomed the fact that we’re likely to see rate cuts,” Turnquist said.
Those wider economic trends have coincided with a burst of investor appetite for tech firms leading the adoption of AI. Major stock indexes drew a bump from investors optimistic about the potential benefits of products like ChatGPT.
Those gains were concentrated primarily in a handful of tech giants, known as the magnificent seven: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia. Even within that group, the gains were enjoyed primarily by a select few.
The stock price of Nvidia -- the maker of many computer chips driving AI advances -- has climbed nearly 150% since the outset of 2024. Microsoft, which owns a major stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has seen its shares soar more than 20% this year.
“The AI effect has helped market sentiment and deservedly so,” Mike Loukas, CEO of TrueMark Investments, told ABC News. “But a handful of concentrated stocks seem to carry the market at any given time.”
In light of the gangbusters performance at the outset of this year, experts warned that the stock market would likely struggle to sustain the returns. At a basic level, the rise in stock prices that stretches back to last year will eventually reach a point where traders become reluctant to pour in funds at an elevated price tag, the analysts said.

“There needs to be a reset button from these overbought conditions,” Turnquist said.
Even more, the positive trends in the economy face a number of threats. Most notably, the ongoing combination of high interest rates and stubborn inflation could weigh on corporate profits and wear investor patience thin.
“The whole dance -- rate cuts or no rate cuts; inflation or no inflation -- I think that continues,” Loukas said. “We’re still pretty sensitive as a whole to macroeconomic factors.”
Such economic uncertainty is compounded by a wide range of possible outcomes in the November election, Loukas added.
“The election is going to be a wild variable,” Loukas said. “There’s a lot of uncertainty in what’s happening and the market is still trying to price that in.”
MORE: Why Nvidia's stock price has dropped
Loukas forecasted growth in the stock market over the remainder of 2024, but he said the pace would fall short of the surge experienced over the first half.
Turnquist, of LPL Financial, echoed that view. The stock market could rise slightly by the end of the year, he said, but companies will weather a more challenging environment.
“There’s still a risk that the battle isn’t over with the Fed,” he added.
Still, Turquist noted, the outlook for the market beyond this year remains favorable. “We’re still in a long-term uptrend,” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,"Brazil's Vinícius Jr. slams Copa organisers over pitches, refs",요약 없음,"Vinícius Júnior criticised the Copa América's pitches, referees and organisers CONMEBOL after putting in a player-of-the-match performance in Brazil's 4-1 win over Paraguay on Friday.
The Real Madrid forward scored twice in a convincing win at Allegiant Stadium, Las Vegas, to leave Brazil on four points in second place in Group D -- behind leaders Colombia -- and on track to qualify for the quarterfinals.
""The Copa América is always difficult because of the pitches, because of the referees -- who always go against us -- and because of the way CONMEBOL treats people,"" Vinícius said post-match. ""It's always difficult, but we have to stay strong. We can only talk by winning. When we talk, CONMEBOL say we talk too much.""
ESPN has approached CONMEBOL for comment.
Brazil had an underwhelming start to the competition, drawing 0-0 with Costa Rica on Monday, with Vinícius coming in for criticism and questions over his role in the team.
However coach Dorival Junior hailed the forward as ""almost perfect"" after his display against Paraguay.
""I played a great game today, in line with the level of player I am,"" Vinícius said.
Opponents Paraguay were less impressed.
""[Vinícius] has a way of playing which is not easy for opponents to accept,"" coach Daniel Garnero said. ""That's why the referee is there. The referee has to impose those limits.""
The state of pitches at the Copa América -- with natural grass being laid on top of artificial turf at six of the venues -- has been frequently discussed at the tournament so far.
Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni criticised the quality of the surface at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta after the opening game there, saying it was ""not suitable for this kind of players"" and goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez calling it ""a disaster.""
On Saturday in Group A, champions Argentina -- who have already qualified for the quarterfinals -- play Peru in Miami, Florida, while Canada play Chile.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Barkett said the mine collapse was reported, as required, to the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration.

Speaking as the ""wife and voice"" of her husband, who has aphasia and can’t speak, Mary Travis testified in D.C. on why the AMFA is important.
Randy Travis and his wife, Mary Travis met with lawmakers and testified on Capitol Hill regarding the American Music Fairness Act.
ABC News
""What would sheet music sound like without a voice, and what would radio sound like without a song?"" she said. ""This piece of legislation is essential to correct a hundred-year-old issue regarding artists and nonpayment for their work performed on the most prominent music platform in America -- one of which they helped to build and sustain.""
A bipartisan bill, the AMFA seeks to ensure music creators are fairly compensated when their songs are played on AM/FM radio.
Radio broadcasters argue that the new performance royalties would financially jeopardize many radio stations, forcing them to cut back on programming, and could lead to stations playing less music and only the most popular songs.
Artists are currently paid on other platforms, including satellite, cable and internet, when their music is played -- but not radio. Songwriters, on the other hand, are paid on all of the aforementioned platforms.
The bill aims to help these artists recover the hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties they are currently losing out on every year.

Randy Travis' wife reflects on how his life suddenly changed after his 2013 stroke
During the testimony, Mary Travis said she likes to call artificial intelligence ""artistic intelligence"" because it enabled her husband to release a new song utilizing the technology ""in its most authentic and artistic way.""
Randy Travis suffered a massive stroke -- among other health issues -- in 2013 that left him with aphasia, robbing him of his ability to perform live and speak.

""This is good AI, but there is bad -- no, there's terrible -- AI out there, and it's increasing exponentially daily,"" she added.

2024-06-27,Texas hospital is reportedly 1st in US to use holograms for doctor-patient visits,"Crescent Regional Hospital in Lancaster, Texas, is reportedly the first hospital in the U.S. to be using a hologram system for some doctor-patient visits.","A Texas hospital could be the first in the United States to use a technology that allows doctors to visit patients via hologram.
Crescent Regional Hospital, located in Lancaster -- about 13 miles south of Dallas -- has installed ""Holobox,"" a 3D system that projects a life-sized hologram of a doctor so that they can perform real-time consults with patients at a clinic 30 miles away.
Designed by Dutch company Holoconnects, the display is 86 inches tall and only requires electricity and internet to connect, according to the company.

The box has anti-glare glass and a transparent LCD screen for a life-size and realistic holographic display as well as hi-fi speakers and a multi-touch operating system, according to Holoconnects' website. The hologram features the image of people either in a pre-recorded video or in live real-time video.
""There's so much artificial intelligence, robotic technology, so many things,"" Crescent Regional Hospital CEO Raji Kumar told ABC affiliate WFAA in Dallas. ""So, I'm super excited of being able to bring some of this technology to North Texas.""
The Crescent Regional Hospital in Lancaster, TX, is seen in a Google Street View capture.

Steve Stirling, managing director of Holoconnects for North America, said the company developed the ""Doctor-Patient Hologram Engagement System"" so medical facilities and health care practitioners can engage with patients remotely.
""It has the potential to revolutionize the access and sense of relationship between patients and their healthcare professionals,"" Stirling told ABC News via email. ""We can provide real-time, life-like access from distant locations which provide patients with access to levels of specialty care from anywhere in the world and also save doctors one of their most precious commodities -- time!""
He believes Crescent Regional is the first hospital in the U.S. with a technology like Holobox.
Kumar said the technology helps reduce doctors' travel time between Crescent Regional and the hospital's clinic in Farmers Branch, about 30 miles away.
Doctors can now speak to patients via hologram instead of driving between the hospital and clinic for pre-op, post-op or follow up appointments, according to WFAA.
""Our doctors on the north side of town don't have to drive 30 miles to see one of their patients,"" Kumar told WFAA. ""They can just hop into the studio have the consult.""
She plans to install more studios throughout the hospital and in doctors' offices so more physicians can do holographic visits. Kumar told WFAA she would also like to bring the technology to rural hospitals.

""I plan to give it as a service to rural hospitals,"" Kumar said. ""To say, 'Hey, I've got all the specialists on board. I will give you the box, I'll take care of the camera setups for my specialists.'""
""I'm actually trying to do a mini box in a mobile van, so I could take it to underserved areas, okay, where there's no specialist help,"" she added.
Stirling said he is hoping more hospitals will follow suit and roll out similar hologram programs. Holoconnects is working to deploy the Holobox Mini, which has a 22-inch interactive touch-screen display and can more easily be transported.
""Doctor shortage areas are everywhere, and health care facilities are closing so if we can do anything to help make access to care and engagement with healthcare professionals more productive and satisfying to both patients and doctors, this will be a very satisfying result for us,"" he said.

날짜 없음,Argentina beats Chile to seal Copa América quarterfinal place,요약 없음,"Lautaro Martínez scored from a rebound in the 88th minute, giving defending champions Argentina and Lionel Messi a 1-0 victory over Chile on Tuesday night that guaranteed a berth in the Copa América quarterfinals.
Messi's corner kick led to a shot blocked by goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, and Martínez scored his second goal of the tournament on Argentina's 21st shot of the match.
""These matches are always like this, we have to continue in the same way, treating the matches in this way, as they are all going to be complicated,"" Martinez told TyC Sports. ""Everything was tight, they set up lines of five at times.
""But we are happy that at the end of the day we ended up taking the three points, which is what we wanted to start with.""
Players stood and waited for three minutes while the goal, Martínez's 26th for the national team, was confirmed in a video review.
Argentina leads Group A with six points, followed by Canada with three and Chile and Peru with one each. The Albiceleste finishes the first round against Peru at Miami Gardens, Florida, on Saturday, while Canada meets Chile in Orlando, Florida.
Playing a day after his 37th birthday, Messi frequently flaunted his talent to spin around and slalom through defenders before an adoring sellout crowd of 81,106 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, site of the 2026 World Cup final. Argentina dominated 21-3 in shots and 11-0 in corner kicks, and Chile didn't take its first attempt until the 72nd minute.
Messi came the closest to scoring before Martínez with a 30-yard shot that glanced off the post to Bravo's left in the 36th minute. Messi had received treatment on the thigh area of his right leg for nearly two minutes after getting kicked by Gabriel Suazo in the 24th.
Nicolás González's shot from another Messi pass in the 62nd was parried off the crossbar by Bravo.
Argentina outshot Chile 17-0 before  Rodrigo Echeverria's 72nd-minute effort following a turnover was saved by Emiliano Martínez. The goalkeeper then made another diving save on Echeverría in the 76th.
On the 46th anniversary of Argentina winning its first World Cup title, the teams returned to the stadium where Chile beat Argentina on penalty kicks in the 2016 Copa América final. That defeat prompted Messi to announce his international retirement only to reverse his decision seven weeks later.
At least 90% of the fans wore Argentina jerseys, most with Messi's name and No. 10.
Bravo, at 41, the oldest player in Copa América history, had eight saves in his 150th international appearance. He and Messi, former Barcelona teammates, spoke with each other while leading their teams onto the field for the national anthems.
""We have a tough group, very evenly matched, we had chances to score,"" Bravo said. ""The next opponent is going to be tough like these two we've had.""
There were some small brown patches behind one goal on a grass field installed at a stadium where the usual surface is artificial turf. The surface was narrow, with construction scheduled to allow a wider field for the World Cup.

2024-06-26,Why Nvidia's stock price has dropped,"After becoming the largest company, Nvidia lost more than $500 billion in value.","When artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia became the world's most valuable company last week -- surpassing household names like Apple and Microsoft -- the moment appeared to be a declaration of victory for the AI boom on Wall Street.
Over the next three trading days, however, Nvidia shares plummeted 13%. The company lost more than $500 billion in value and plopped down to third place among the largest firms.
Rather than a rebuke of AI or Nvidia, the extraordinary losses amounted to a routine selloff on a massive scale as traders sought to cash in on some of the gains made by the chipmaker during its meteoric rise, market analysts told ABC News.
Analysts differed on whether the recent slide offers a worthwhile opportunity for investors to buy the stock at a favorable price.
""It's normal to see stocks take a breath,"" Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at trading firm Interactive Broker, told ABC News. ""What's abnormal is that Nvidia went so far and so long without taking a breath.""

It's difficult to overstate the success that Nvidia enjoyed prior to its recent decline. The California-based company, which sells the majority of computer chips behind new AI products like ChatGPT, saw its stock soar nearly 700% in two years.
Even when accounting for the recent decline, shares of Nvidia have climbed nearly 150% since the outset of 2024.
After a prolonged ascent, stocks often fall victim to a phenomenon called profit-taking, when traders sell off some of their shares to lock in the returns. In this case, analysts said, that routine pullback was larger than one might expect because the preceding rise had been unusually steep.
""It's not normal to have a stock go up this dramatically,"" Sosnick said. ""As a result, when it's due for a little bout of profit taking, that will be abnormal, too.""
Ivan Feinseth, a market analyst at Tigress Financial, agreed. ""The stock has had a huge run,"" Feinseth told ABC News. ""Some people who are more short-term oriented feel it's time to take a profit.""
While citing a trend tied to market behavior rather than business performance, the analysts dismissed the notion of newfound weakness in the AI sector or Nvidia.

In an earnings release last month, the company reported $26 billion in revenue, which marked a staggering increase of 262% over the previous year. Profits jumped more than 600% over that same period.
In March, the company announced its latest and most powerful chip, Blackwell. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI are among a who's who of major tech firms set to adopt the new technology, Nvidia said in a statement.
""It's Nvidia's world -- everyone else is paying,"" Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at investment firm Wedbush, told ABC News.
Despite their agreement on the cause of the stock decline, analysts differed in their assessment of whether the current moment offers a chance for investors to jump into the stock.

Feinseth encouraged investors to buy into the stock, since he expects the dip to draw renewed interest in the company and send the price higher. ""This is a stock that everybody wants to own and everybody is going to react to buying any selloff,"" he said.
Early trading on Tuesday appeared to confirm that view. By noon, the stock had risen almost 5%, recovering much of what it had lost in recent days.
""This was just a small bump,"" Ives said.
Sosnick, by contrast, cautioned against buying Nvidia shares unless the price falls further. Otherwise, he added, the relatively modest potential gains do not outweigh the risk of continued volatility.
""The stock is not super expensive but nor is it particularly cheap,"" Sosnick said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-06-25,Should there be a law on what age a child can have a cellphone?,ABC News contributor Mike Muse talks about the new ban on cellphones in classrooms in Los Angeles and whether or not there should be a legal age a child can get the device.,"Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,Argentina slams Mercedes-Benz pitch: 'Better that we won',요약 없음,"The Argentina national team slammed the pitch at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium for the inaugural match of the 2024 Copa América on Thursday night, with goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez calling the newly installed grass surface a ""disaster"" and manager Lionel Scaloni saying it was ""better that we won.""
""The state of the pitch was a disaster,"" the Aston Villa goalkeeper said. ""Very bumpy. We must improve in this aspect; otherwise, Copa América will always appear at a lower level than the European Championship.""
La Albiceleste triumphed 2-0 over Canada as goals from Julián Álvarez and Lautaro Martínez secured the team the top spot in the Group A standings. But Scaloni used the victory as an opportunity to call out the conditions at the home of the NFL's  Atlanta Falcons -- a synthetic surface that was covered with natural grass just two days ago -- by criticizing the organization's poor planning.
""The game was like that of Saudi Arabia in the World Cup, except that one had a good pitch,"" Scaloni said, referencing his team's opening-game loss in Qatar in 2022. ""Better that we won, or else it would have appeared as an excuse, but they knew seven months ago that we'd play here and they changed the field two days ago. It's not an excuse, but this isn't a good field. Sincerely, the field is not apt for these players.
""We gave not necessarily a good game, but a game according to the pitch and what the rival proposed. We couldn't do much more with the conditions of the pitch. Look at the speed of the passes that we did.""
In addition to the Falcons, Mercedes-Benz Stadium is also the home of MLS' Atlanta United FC -- both teams play on the artificial surface. At CONMEBOL's request, the stadium put in grass for the tournament.
When Atlanta United faced the Houston Dynamo on Saturday, the venue still had an artificial surface.
""Two days ago it was fake, and then they parched panels of grass together. It's painted to appear nicer than it is,"" Scaloni said. ""The weird thing is we knew months ago we'd play here, so maybe things could've been done about the pitch quicker.""
Canada defender Kamal Miller also criticized the pitch where his national team played its first Copa América match in its history.
""It felt like walking on a stage, as if it was hollow,"" Miller said.
A crowd of 70,564 attended the opener of the 32-game tournament. The United States plays Panama at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium on June 27.
The stadium will host eight games during the 2026 World Cup, including a semifinal.
Next up for Argentina in Group A is a match against Chile at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on Tuesday. Canada will face  Peru on the same day at Children's Mercy Park in Kansas City.

Argentina is seeking its third straight major title after winning the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 World Cup and they got things underway at a sold out Mercedes-Benz Stadium.
With South America's championship moved to the United States for the second time, Messi set a Copa América record by playing in his 35th match, one more than Chile's Sergio Livingstone from 1941 to 1953. Messi extended his own record with his 18th assist.
Messi, who turns 37 on Monday, created the first goal when he headed a pass through the defense for  Alexis Mac Allister. The midfielder side-footed to Álvarez while crashing into onrushing goalkeeper  Maxime Crépeau about 8 yards out. Álvarez had a virtually empty net and kicked the ball in over a sliding defender for his eighth goal in 32 international appearances.
Messi extended his Copa América record when he ran through the center of the midfield and rolled a pass to Martínez, who got his 25th international goal.
Messi's best scoring chance was in the 65th minute, when Crépeau made a diving stop and Messi's attempt off the rebound was blocked by the head of defender Derek Cornelius. Messi put a chip wide after he came in alone on Crépeau in the 79th.
The Inter Miami star was shaken up by a sliding tackle from defender  Moïse Bombito in the 82nd minute, but remained in the game.
Argentina plays Chile on Tuesday at East Rutherford, New Jersey, then closes the first round against Peru on June 29 at Miami Gardens, Florida. Canada faces Peru on Tuesday at Kansas City, Kansas, and finishes the group stage against Chile on June 29 at Orlando, Florida.
Fourteen U.S. stadiums are hosting the tournament, which runs through June 14 and ends at Miami Gardens. Six nations from Concacaf were added to the 10 South American teams, just as in the centennial Copa América in 2016.
Slow starts did not prevent the Albiceleste from winning their previous two tournaments. Argentina opened the 2022 World Cup with a 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia and began the 2021 Copa América with a 1-1 draw against Chile.
Canada made its Copa América debut and played its first competitive match under American coach Jesse Marsch, who was hired on May 13. The former Leeds and New York Red Bulls coach said his side did its best against Messi, but couldn't contain him the whole night.
""Yeah, we talked a lot about our compactness and then identifying the spaces that Messi likes to show up,"" Marsch said. ""We talked about not diving in because it's hard to win tackles from him and what happens is if you eliminate yourself or if you start diving in for tackles, he's really good slipping and moving and getting back again and making little final plays.
""This is what I say about Messi. I've coached against him several times and I feel like we've had a good match plan and we've executed a lot of good things. He's so good, he's that good that he still makes plays. The two balls he makes on the two goals I think are world class. Amazing, it's awful. It's amazing.""

Murgia asserts that AI has stealthily integrated into our daily lives, operating in ways that often go unnoticed.
Murgia said AI is utilized in the criminal justice system to determine whether someone should be granted bail. Additionally, it is employed in health care to aid in diagnosing various illnesses, including cancer.
She focuses mainly on the negative aspects of AI, but Murgia believes AI will bring significant changes to science and health care. In particular, she discusses how AI can assist in diagnosing diseases in areas with a shortage of doctors and medical professionals.
ABC News sat down with Murgia to discuss more about AI.
VIDEO: Madhumita Murgia dissects AI from the human level in her book 'Code-Dependent'
ABCNews.com
ABC NEWS LIVE: From doing your homework to writing the latest song to the looming threat of it taking your job, artificial intelligence has become almost unavoidable. Yet, according to our next guest, we're only beginning to recognize its impact and involvement in our daily lives.
In her new book, ""Code Dependent: Living in the Shadow of AI,"" Madhumita Murgia is looking from the human level and how these automated systems are reshaping our lives. Madhumita, thank you so much for joining us.
MURGIA: Thanks for having me.
ABC NEWS LIVE: So you take a look at the unexpected ways that AI might impact our lives. Give us an example of some things that we might not be thinking about just yet.
MURGIA: Yeah. So there's all these really invisible and insidious ways in which AI is already part of our daily lives. You know, we might think of it as the social media recommendations that we get. Or, you know, what Netflix suggests that we watch.
But AI is often behind things like whether you get a loan for your car or your mortgage, for example. It's used in criminal justice to decide whether someone might get bail or not, whether they should be awarded or denied bail. It's used in health care systems to help to diagnose certain illnesses, including cancers.
ABC NEWS LIVE: And you take your reporting outside of Silicon Valley and look at the way algorithms are trained or created and the people behind them. What did you find?
MURGIA: So, you know, it's almost impossible to avoid Silicon Valley when you're talking about AI, right? But I knew that these systems had infiltrated and sort of rippled out far beyond, you know, California, beyond the U.S. even. And I found, you know, there are laborers, factory workers that are helping to label algorithms to help them see.
So, for example, your Tesla that has sort of self-driving aspects to it. In order for those AI systems to know what they're looking at, you have human beings that are labeling. That's a saying, that's a pedestrian, that's a traffic light, that's a road. They don't just automatically know things. They're not magic.
So you actually have factories of laborers being paid minimum wage in the developing world, in the global South, who are telling the AI systems what they need to know. So that was one of the sort of hidden workforces that I, that I met with and learned about.
ABC NEWS LIVE: A lot of the book focuses really on the downsides of artificial intelligence, but you did find some, some positive developments in particular with regard to health care. Explain that.
MURGIA: Yeah. So for me, I think that's the most hopeful and kind of optimistic view that I have of AI -- is how it's going to change science and health, really.
And with health care, in particular, I look at how it can help in diagnosing diseases where there are not enough doctors or medical professionals, you know, where there's huge lack of access that might be in parts of the U.S., or in rural parts of India, you know, where people don't, can't see a doctor, but you can have these apps that literally look at pictures of their, you know, X-rays or CT scans and tell you whether they might have breast cancer, you know, whether they might have tuberculosis, COVID, all of these diseases, as well as a human doctor can.
ABC NEWS LIVE: It could be transformative to use your word. And in all that you've learned in your research, is there anything that kind of keeps you up at night?
MURGIA: So for me, it's about preserving the dignity of human beings, right? You know, it's great to have technology to augment and help us to do the things we don't want to do. You know, there was this meme going around saying, I want AI to do my laundry and my dishes so that I can do art, right. And writing. I don't want it to do my art and my writing and then leave me to do the laundry and the dishes.
And so that's what I hope doesn't happen, that we sort of allow these automated systems to take over the things that make us human, that we love to do, and leave us as the sort of second-class citizens in this transformation.
ABC NEWS LIVE: When we look at this, you know, fast forward, I want to say way into the future. But really, we already know that the impacts are happening now and in the coming years. But, you know, you think about some of the Hollywood renditions of this, and it's like robots end up ruling the world. Is that where you feel like all this leads?
MURGIA: I don't think this is about ""Terminator"" robots somehow trampling out humanity in that very obvious way. I think it's a lot more insidious, and I think the fixes are human, too. It's not about a technology running wild. It's about how can we create the controls and draw the lines for ourselves?
ABC NEWS LIVE: It's such a fascinating conversation to have. We so appreciate you Madhumita so bringing us some of your insight and what you've gleaned. Really appreciate it. Want to let our viewers know you can get ""Code Dependent: Living in the Shadow of AI"" out tomorrow [June 18] wherever books are sold.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-06-18,Surgeon general calls for health warnings on social media for younger users,The U.S. surgeon general called on Monday for social media platforms to include health warnings for younger users.,"The U.S. surgeon general called on Monday for social media platforms to include health warnings for younger users.
""One of the most important lessons I learned in medical school was that in an emergency, you don’t have the luxury to wait for perfect information. You assess the available facts, you use your best judgment, and you act quickly,"" Vivek H. Murthy wrote in an op-ed published in The New York Times ""The mental health crisis among young people is an emergency -- and social media has emerged as an important contributor.""
“It is time to require a surgeon general’s warning label on social media platforms, stating that social media is associated with significant mental health harms for adolescents,” he wrote, calling on Congress to take action to require such a label.
Murthy cited the success of surgeon general's warning labels on cigarette packs -- which Congress mandated in the 1960s -- as an example of what the action could do for social media use among kids.
""Evidence from tobacco studies show that warning labels can increase awareness and change behavior,"" he wrote, while also citing in the op-ed examples of other industries where Congress has required safety measures, including seatbelts, airbags, crash testing and food recalls.
""Why is it that we have failed to respond to the harms of social media when they are no less urgent or widespread than those posed by unsafe cars, planes or food?"" wrote Murthy, a father of two. ""These harms are not a failure of willpower and parenting; they are the consequence of unleashing powerful technology without adequate safety measures, transparency or accountability.""

Murthy's office had last year issued an advisory on social media use and its possible affects on teenage users. He called at that time on social media companies to prioritize safety and privacy in their product designs and ensure minimum age requirements are enforced.
In his op-ed, Murthy noted that requiring a surgeon's general warning on social media platforms is just one of many protective factors needed to help better protect kids. He called on Congress to enact legislation to ""shield young people"" from exploitation and abuse online, and called on social media companies to share data on the ""public health effects"" of their products and to allow for independent safety audits.
Murthy said that society as a whole also has a role to play.
""Schools should ensure that classroom learning and social time are phone-free experiences,"" he wrote. ""Parents, too, should create phone-free zones around bedtime, meals and social gatherings to safeguard their kids’ sleep and real-life connections -- both of which have direct effects on mental health. And they should wait until after middle school to allow their kids access to social media. his is much easier said than done, which is why parents should work together with other families to establish shared rules, so no parents have to struggle alone or feel guilty when their teens say they are the only one who has to endure limits.""

Following the surgeon general's call for a warning label for social media, a White House spokesperson underscored the administration's support of tackling the mental health crisis in the U.S., calling on Congress to ""hold social media platforms accountable.""
""The Surgeon General’s announcement is about reminding parents and kids of the risks of using social media. The President will continue to focus on addressing the mental health crisis and calls on Congress to hold social media platforms accountable,"" the official said, not explicitly endorsing the label proposal but expressing support for board action on the issue.
Most social media platforms have a minimum user age of 13, which Murthy has said previously he believes is ""too early"" for kids to be on social media, describing the age as a ""time when kids are developing their identity, their sense of self.""
Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who have been working to advance the Kids Online Safety Act for over a year, said they were ""pleased"" by the surgeon general's call for a warning label on social media.
""We are pleased that the Surgeon General -- America’s top doctor -- continues to bring attention to the harmful impact that social media has on our children,"" the senators said in a statement.
The Kids Online Safety Act has 62 co-sponsors in the Senate, making it all but certain to clear the 60-vote threshold necessary to pass legislation through the upper chamber. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has expressed support for the legislation but so far has not brought it to the floor for a vote.
Dr. Vivek Murthy appears on ""Good Morning America.""
ABC News
On average, teens report using social media for 3.5 hours a day, with many spending more than seven hours a day on these platforms, according to the advisory Murthy issued last year.
One study, published in the medical journal JAMA Psychiatry, found that kids ages 12 to 15 who spend more than three hours per day on social media had double the rate of mental health issues like depression and anxiety.
Other studies also suggest that for young people who are already experiencing depression, reducing the number of hours spent on social media can help ease depression scores
MORE: US surgeon general issues major advisory on social media use and teens' mental health
Psychologists say that adolescent brain development starts around age 10 and continues through early adulthood.
In issuing first-of-its-kind guidance for social media and teenagers last year, the American Psychological Association cautioned that sites that use ""like"" buttons and artificial intelligence to encourage excessive scrolling ""may be dangerous for developing brains"" and recommends limiting social media use on these types of platforms through phone settings.
In addition to setting limits, the APA strongly encouraged in its recommendations ongoing discussions about social media use and active supervision, especially in early adolescence. Parents are encouraged to model healthy social media use, including taking social media ""holidays"" as a family.
Children should also be monitored for problematic social media use, including interference with normal routines, choosing social media over in-person interactions, lack of physical activity, strong cravings to check social media and lying to spend more time online. In these cases, a mental health provider might be able to help, according to the APA.

2024-06-14,Biden signs security agreement with Ukraine at G7 summit,"President Joe Biden and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, signed a security agreement to bolster Ukraine’s defenses for 10 years.","Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.
The Albertsons logo is displayed at an Albertsons supermarket on August 26, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-06-13,"At G7, Biden to push $50B loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets",The summit starts Thursday in Italy.,"President Joe Biden's key priority at the G7 summit in Italy this week is to solidify an agreement that could provide some $50 billion to Ukraine using profits from frozen Russian assets, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The U.S. argues this is a solution to relieve Ukraine’s desperate battlefield situation using Russian funds instead of taxpayer dollars. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky will attend the summit to personally drive home the urgency.

Biden is also expected to meet with Zelensky this week -- their second meeting in a week after their sit down in Paris.
Yet, the seven member countries have not reached a consensus. They will be negotiating the details during the summit, aiming to announce the agreement in the G7 communique at the end of the summit this week, the source added.
This plan to finance Ukraine would send a powerful message to Russia’s Vladimir Putin that he will not outlast the U.S. and its allies’ support for Ukraine, regardless of how elections in their countries unfold, according to the source.

But the G7 nations have to hammer out tricky details, including how disbursement would work and what the repayment assurances would be, the source said. European countries also have differing views on utilizing these profits, with some preferring direct spending on weapons. There are also complicated legal issues and concerns about who would back the loan.
Israel/Hamas war
This is the first G7 summit since the Hamas Oct. 7 attack on Israel. While there have been divisions among member countries over the war, the countries have now unified around President Biden’s plan for a cease-fire. Earlier this month, G7 leaders released a joint statement formally endorsing Biden’s plan and calling on Hamas to accept it.
China
Another key area of discussion among leaders is countering China’s trade practices and overcapacity. According to the source, the G7 nations agree that China’s excess industrial capacity poses a global problem.
The fear is that a flood of heavily subsidized products from China -- including steel, machinery, solar products, electric vehicles, and batters -- would decimate those industries in the U.S. and other countries. Last month, President Biden significantly increased tariffs on Chinese imports in strategic sectors, while leaving in place tariffs on more than $300 billion worth of Chinese goods that Trump had imposed.
Pope Francis, AI
Pope Francis will attend the summit to speak about artificial intelligence, another top priority at the G7. Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically.",,,,,,,,,,,,

2024-06-11,Apple reveals artificial intelligence to power your Siri,The company announced its big move into AI during its WWDC 2024 conference keynote.,"Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-06-11,"Apple launches AI-fueled tools for iPhone, Mac and iPad","Apple CEO Tim Cook described AI capability as ""the next big step for Apple.""","Apple unveiled artificial intelligence-fueled features across several key products on Monday, heralding the long-awaited entry of the tech giant into the high-stakes AI race.
The latest version of Apple's operating system will deliver customizable tools using generative AI for iPhones, Mac and iPad, Apple said at the Worldwide Developers Conference hosted at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, California. Language tools will be able to improve or summarize text, and image generators will supplement photos with extra adornment.
The AI capability, called Apple Intelligence, amounts to the ""next big step for Apple,"" CEO Tim Cook said on Monday. The advance results from an agreement between Apple and OpenAI, the firm behind popular text bot ChatGPT, Cook added.
A revamped Siri, for instance, will draw on generative chat technology to improve its language comprehension and retain context from previous requests, the company said.
Since its launch in 2011, Siri has functioned primarily as a hands-free tool for responses to specific prompts, such as queries about the weather or a user's upcoming calendar. The new version, Apple said, will carry out extended conversations and aid in intricate tasks.
Further, Siri will be able to take actions within a user's product, pulling up photos or adding text to the Notes app, the company said.

OpenAI retains a longstanding partnership with Microsoft, which holds a minority stake in the firm and integrates ChatGPT into its Bing search engine. Last year, Google announced its own AI model called Bard, which provides brief summaries in response to some search queries.
The announcement on Monday amounts to the most important decision for Apple -- and Cook -- over the last decade, Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush, told clients in a research note ahead of the conference.

In recent years, the company has relied on new models of its signature items, instead of transitioning to the next big product, analysts previously told ABC News.

2024-06-10,"10 primaries to watch in South Carolina, North Dakota, Maine and Nevada","Tuesday's elections include notable Republican primary races in South Carolina, North Dakota, Maine and Nevada.","Tuesday is primary day in four states, and as always, 538 is keeping a close eye on the day's key competitive races. Every single one of our 10 elections to watch is a Republican primary, but they're split into two categories. In South Carolina and North Dakota, five contests for the U.S. House of Representatives and governor are all-but-guaranteed to decide the eventual November winner on solidly red turf. By comparison, Maine and Nevada have an array of five Republican primaries for the U.S. Senate and House in competitive seats currently held by Democrats that the GOP hopes to flip this fall.
You can get caught up on all these races here, and you can tune in to our liveblog Tuesday evening to follow the action as it happens, where we'll be tracking the ins and outs of these 10 primaries and anything else that pops up on our radar as the votes come in.
South Carolina
Races to watch: 1st, 3rd and 4th congressional districts
Polls close: 7 p.m. Eastern
The most-watched South Carolina race is in the 1st District, where second-term Republican Rep. Nancy Mace is defending her Lowcountry-based seat against a primary challenge from former state cabinet official Catherine Templeton. Mace sparked anger among some in the GOP last fall after she joined with seven other Republican House members to back the motion to vacate that ousted then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Her support came as a surprise because McCarthy had backed her in 2020 when she first ran here, but the move fit into her idiosyncratic track record as a onetime-ally of the old school GOP establishment who has evolved into an anti-establishment, Trump-minded conservative, at least in her rhetoric. That shift may also reflect a self-preserving political recalibration after redistricting made her once-competitive seat redder ahead of the 2022 election.
But the strategy could have its pitfalls: In Templeton, Mace has an establishment-aligned opponent who previously served in then-Gov. Nikki Haley's cabinet before mounting a failed gubernatorial bid in 2018. And while Mace has substantially outraised Templeton — $2.3 million to $663,000 as of May 22 — Templeton has received ample outside support. Groups have spent $5.3 million backing Templeton or attacking Mace, according to OpenSecrets, compared with $2.6 million supporting Mace or criticizing Templeton. Notably, some pro-Templeton money may have come from sources allied to McCarthy, and Mace has denounced Templeton as McCarthy's ""puppet."" The McCarthy-aligned American Prosperity Alliance is running ads against Mace, and reporting by the Charleston Post and Courier found that the brand-new South Carolina Patriots PAC — which has spent $3.8 million to boost Templeton — received a small amount of money from the APA. SCP has run ads that argue Mace is weak on border security, while Templeton has played up her conservative business and immigration bona fides.
However, Mace may have the ultimate, er, trump card: Former President Donald Trump has endorsed her, a development Mace and her allies, such as Club for Growth Action, have emphasized in campaign ads. This reflects the incumbent's shifting positions, especially considering Trump endorsed Mace's primary challenger in 2022, whom Mace narrowly defeated. Still, Trump's support may not be an unalloyed positive: The 1st District is the only one Haley carried versus Trump in South Carolina's February presidential primary.
Limited public polling suggests Mace is more likely than not to survive. An early May survey by Kaplan Strategies found Mace leading Templeton 43 percent to 21 percent, while a late May poll from Emerson College/The Hill put Mace ahead 47 percent to 22 percent. But there's a small chance that this race could go to a June 25 runoff, as a third Republican candidate could win enough votes to keep Mace or Templeton from winning a majority.
In the solidly red 4th District around Greenville, third-term Rep. William Timmons is another Republican incumbent dealing with a high-profile primary challenger. Though Timmons is a reliable conservative, state Rep. Adam Morgan could successfully run even further to Timmons's right, seeing as he chairs the state House's Freedom Caucus — modeled after the congressional caucus, whose membership encouraged Morgan's bid and whose campaign arm has endorsed him. Moreover, Timmons still seems to be plagued by a scandal that jeopardized his reelection bid two years ago: In 2022, amid allegations that Timmons was unfaithful to his wife, he only won renomination with 53 percent against weak primary opposition despite the fact his district barely changed in redistricting.
One sign that Timmons is feeling the heat is that he's done something unusual in a GOP primary: He's attacked his opponent for being too extreme on abortion rights, running an ad criticizing Morgan for voting ""to jail rape and incest victims"" who sought abortions — a vote Morgan has defended as ""an attempt to close a loophole."" Timmons's maneuver could be an attempt to draw Democratic and independent votes in South Carolina's open primary system, even though the incumbent supports a 15-week federal abortion ban.
Timmons still has some notable advantages working for him. He's outraised Morgan $1.9 million to $578,000, helped out by a $900,000 loan to his campaign (Morgan has self-funded nearly half his campaign, too). Outside groups, mainly the pro-cryptocurrency Defend American Jobs super PAC, have spent $1.9 million to boost Timmons, compared with just $319,000 in outside spending supporting Morgan. And here, too, Trump has endorsed the incumbent, which Timmons and his allies have played up in campaign ads. Still, Morgan has emphasized his Republican bona fides, pitching himself as a Christian and ""conservative fighter"" in his ads. We've seen no public polling here, so it's hard to know how close this race truly is.
The strongly Republican 3rd District next door features an open-seat race following the retirement of Republican Rep. Jeff Duncan, who also faced accusations of marital infidelity. In the GOP primary to succeed Duncan, the most notable contenders appear to be pastor Mark Burns, Air National Guard Lt. Col. Sheri Biggs and state Rep. Stewart Jones, but it's difficult to identify a favorite — or differentiate between them, as all three candidates have made the case that they're the most conservative, Trump-minded choice. On the fundraising front, Biggs had raised $528,000 as of May 22, while Burns had brought in $516,000, both largely through self-funding. Jones, meanwhile, had raised $217,000 with less self-funding, having represented a part of this region in the state legislature since 2019.
There's been comparably less outside intervention here, highlighted by the Sen. Rand Paul-associated Protect Freedom PAC's $670,000 outlay to help Jones and Elect Principled Veterans Fund's $314,000 to support Biggs. But it's Burns who has garnered Trump's critical endorsement. Burns's political profile as a pro-Trump Black televangelist has grown in recent years, including a second-place finish in the 4th District's 2022 primary. But he's attracted controversy, too, including in 2016 when he retweeted a fake photo of Hillary Clinton in blackface, and in 2022 when he called for the execution and arrest of those who support protecting transgender children. For her part, Biggs has the support of Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, while Jones gained notice for his efforts to dismantle COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions. A runoff seems like a real possibility: The only public poll was a mid-May survey by Cygnal on behalf of the pro-Biggs Elect Principled Veterans Fund, which found all three contenders hovering around 10 percent.
Maine
Races to watch: 2nd Congressional District
Polls close: 8 p.m. Eastern
Maine's 2nd District is host to a GOP primary in which two first-term state representatives, Austin Theriault and Mike Soboleski, are contending for the right to take on three-term Democratic Rep. Jared Golden. The incumbent has managed to hold onto this seat, which takes in most of Maine north of its southern coastal area, despite its slight Republican lean: Trump would have carried it 51 percent to 45 percent in 2020, according to Daily Kos Elections, making it the second-most Republican-leaning seat (by presidential vote) that a Democratic incumbent is defending in 2024, trailing only Rep. Mary Peltola's at-large seat in Alaska.
Theriault, a former NASCAR driver, looks to be favored. He has Trump's endorsement, which he's naturally emphasized in his ads, and he's congressional Republicans' top choice, having earned the backing of Speaker Mike Johnson and the Congressional Leadership Fund, the principal super PAC involved in supporting Republican House candidates. Moreover, Theriault has raised $1.2 million to Soboleski's $117,000. The only somewhat recent poll was an early April survey from Public Opinion Strategies on behalf of Theriault's campaign that found him leading Soboleski 30 percent to 7 percent. But while Theriault has Trump's backing, Soboleski aligns with the former president — and around two-thirds of Republicans nationally — on the question of the 2020 election's legitimacy. Unlike Theriault, Soboleski has echoed Trump's unsupported claim that Biden didn't legitimately win.
North Dakota
Races to watch: At-Large Congressional District; governor
Polls close: Generally 8 p.m. Eastern in most of the state, 9 p.m. Eastern in southwestern counties
North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum's retirement has precipitated an expensive and increasingly ugly Republican primary for governor between Rep. Kelly Armstrong and Lt. Gov. Tammy Miller. Armstrong is more familiar to voters, having served in Congress since 2019, while Burgum tapped Miller as his new lieutenant governor in December 2022 (after the previous officeholder resigned to return to the private sector). Both candidates have thrown around large sums of their own money: Based on financial reports though May 2 and large donations reported through June 7, about $3.8 million of the $4.2 million Miller has reported raising has come out of her own pocket, while Armstrong has self-funded almost $1.3 million of the $3.4 million he's collected.
Armstrong is the front-runner, having garnered endorsements from Trump and the state GOP. He also held a clear lead in three different surveys conducted in May, all of which showed him receiving close to 60 percent while Miller only attracted around 20 percent. Looking to gain ground, Miller has tried to link herself to Trump and Burgum, who's endorsed her. She's also run negative ads against Armstrong, including one that Rob Port of InForum described as ""the most brutal"" he'd seen in North Dakota that accuses Armstrong of insider trading and defending a child molester when he was a lawyer. Armstrong's campaign called the insider trading claim a lie, and the victims in the molestation case called for Miller to stop running ads about it. And Armstrong isn't without his own ad controversy, as his campaign ran a spot against Miller that included a citation from an artificial intelligence news website, which prompted Miller to criticize Armstrong for running ""fake news"" about her record.
Armstrong's gubernatorial bid has left the state's At-Large Congressional District up for grabs, and the two main contenders in the Republican primary look to be Public Service Commissioner Julie Fedorchak and former state Rep. Rick Becker. Fedorchak has a solid electoral record, having won three statewide races to retain her current office, and she earned Trump's endorsement in late May. Meanwhile, Becker has a complicated relationship with the GOP: During his legislative tenure, Becker founded a far-right caucus, and in 2022, he actually ran for Senate as an independent against Republican Sen. John Hoeven. That campaign left Becker ineligible for the state GOP endorsement vote in April, but his supporters spoiled their ballots to give the endorsement to a minor candidate instead of Fedorchak.
Meanwhile, Becker and his allies have mostly kept up with Fedorchak in the money race. Fedorchak has brought in $979,000, compared with Becker's $911,000, although Becker self-funded $550,000 of his haul. Yet outside groups have spent slightly more promoting Becker or attacking Fedorchak ($1.5 million) than on supporting Fedorchak or opposing Becker ($1.3 million). Both candidates have emphasized their pro-Trump views and plans to secure the border. Two surveys have shown a close race, too: An early May poll from DFM Research/North Dakota United put Becker ahead 29 percent to 26 percent, while a late May survey from WPA Intelligence/North Dakota News Cooperative found Fedorchak leading 32 percent to 25 percent. However, both polls predated Trump's endorsement, and, in a possible signal that Fedorchak has the upper hand, the pro-Becker Club for Growth canceled a planned ad buy for the final week of the campaign.
Nevada
Races to watch: U.S. Senate; 1st, 3rd and 4th congressional districts
Polls close: 10 p.m. Eastern
Nevada will hold a pivotal Senate contest this fall for the seat held by Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen, who is seeking a second term. Retired U.S. Army Capt. Sam Brown is the front-runner in the Republican primary, having established himself by finishing second for the GOP nomination in Nevada's 2022 Senate race. Brown's candidacy is highlighted by his military service record, during which time he suffered third-degree burns from a 2008 roadside bomb explosion in Afghanistan. Brown has proved a prodigious fundraiser, having brought in $7.1 million as of May 22. Former Ambassador to Iceland Jeffrey Ross Gunter, who served under Trump, is Brown's main competition, and he's self-funded $2.7 million of the $3.3 million he's raised.
National Republicans have largely consolidated behind Brown, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Brown and the NRSC have run joint ads focused on immigration and national security, and Rosen's campaign is already running spots against him focused on abortion rights. Trump has notably not endorsed in this race, though on Sunday he complimented Brown and seemed to acknowledge his frontrunner status, For his part, Gunter has linked himself to Trump, and has run ads claiming Brown backs the controversial-but-stalled plan to store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain. Brown expressed support for the plan during his 2022 bid, but has backtracked in the face of criticism this time around.
It's unclear how big a threat Gunter is to Brown, as an early June survey from Noble Predictive Insights found Brown ahead 53 percent to 15 percent, similar to the results in a mid-May survey conducted by the Tarrance Group for Brown's campaign and the NRSC. But Gunter released a late May survey by Kaplan Strategies that found him running about even with Brown at around 30 percent. Outside groups have come in big for Brown to the tune of $4.2 million, and Gunter is enough of a danger that the pro-Brown Duty First Nevada super PAC is running ads portraying Gunter as a fake Republican. Still, Gunter's campaign actually canceled some ad buys ahead of the primary — not exactly a signal of confidence.
Nevada's 3rd District is a light-blue seat around Las Vegas held by three-term Democratic Rep. Susie Lee that will likely host the state's most competitive House race. The two most notable Republican contenders may be video game music composer Marty O'Donnell and former state Treasurer Dan Schwartz, although policy analyst and advocate Drew Johnson and former state Sen. Elizabeth Helgelien are also in the mix. O'Donnell has Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo's endorsement, and he'd raised $541,000 as of May 22 ($500,000 out of his own pocket). That was less than the $922,000 Schwartz had raised ($900,000 in self-funding). But on May 24, O'Donnell gave himself an additional $700,000, meaning he's likely outdistanced Schwartz's total. Meanwhile, Johnson has raised $432,000 ($300,000 self-funded) and Helgelien has raised $282,000.
Interestingly, O'Donnell has said he won't accept money from corporate political action committees, a line we more typically hear from Democrats. This may help explain why Johnson has called O'Donnell a ""Seattle liberal."" Meanwhile, Schwartz has cast himself as the candidate who will ""drain the swamp,"" but his post-treasurer electoral track record isn't inspiring: He lost GOP primaries for governor in 2018, U.S. House in 2020 and lieutenant governor in 2022. Helgelien left the state legislature in 2012, but she does have endorsements from Trump acolytes like Roger Stone and hard-right Republican Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Anna Paulina Luna of Florida.
Next door, Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford will be defending the blue-leaning 4th District, and the two principal GOP contenders are retired Air Force Lt. Col. David Flippo and former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee. Flippo has raised $927,000 to Lee's $851,000 — both candidates have self-funded more than half of their totals — but Lee may have the upper hand here, thanks to endorsements from Trump and Lombardo. However, Lee is a former Democrat who switched parties ahead of a failed bid for the Republican nomination for governor against Lombardo in 2022, which could weaken his appeal among primary voters.
Lastly, there's a GOP primary to monitor in the 1st District, another light-blue seat in and around Las Vegas held by Democratic Rep. Dina Titus. In the 2022 general election, Titus defeated Army veteran Mark Robertson by nearly 6 percentage points, but Robertson is back for another go. However, he's only raised $106,000, a figure dwarfed by restaurateur Flemming Larsen, a GOP rival who has brought in a whopping $1.8 million thanks to $1.5 million in self-funding. It's unclear if a recent report by the Nevada Independent disclosing that Larsen hired undocumented immigrants at his southern California restaurants will notably impact the race.",,,,,,,,,,,,

New York City police officers investigate a shooting on June 3, 2024, that left two girls, ages 9 and 11, wounded at a Hilltop Playground in Brownsville, Brooklyn.

The injured girls were identified by relatives as 9-year-old Ruanna Brown and her 11-year-old cousin, Empress Alexander Davis.
Empress' mother was sitting on a nearby park bench watching the girls play on the artificial grass of the playground's main field when the shooting occurred, relatives said.
""My heart fell out of my chest to hear my daughter was shot. First thing I thought was Lord take my life and not hers,"" Ruanna's mother, Melissa Alexander, told ABC New York City station WABC. ""I'm lost for words. I'm devastated. I'm hurt. I cried all night, all morning. I just want my baby to be safe.""

Alexander said her daughter was shot in her right knee while Empress, who remained hospitalized Tuesday, was hit in the back.
Ruanna told WABC Tuesday that she is ""feeling OK.""
""I was a little nervous so I didn't talk too much but the doctors were trying to make me talk a lot so I wouldn't fall asleep,"" said Ruanna, who was released from the hospital and is recovering at home. ""So, I didn't really have a lot to say, but they were asking me questions about my summer.""
Alexander said her daughter woke up all night because she was afraid she was alone.
In an interview from her hospital bed, Empress recalled details of the shooting.
""I could feel my shoulder, and then my cousin was screaming about a leg or a knee,"" Empress told WABC.
The shooting erupted around 9:05 p.m. as the girls were playing, Assistant Chief Scott Henderson, commanding officer of the Brooklyn North patrol division, said at a news conference at the playground where the girls were shot.
""Unfortunately, we're here on a nice spring evening to talk about yet another senseless act of gun violence directed toward our most vulnerable youth,"" Henderson said.
Henderson said the preliminary investigation indicates that two gunmen fired at least six rounds at an individual. While the gunshots missed the targeted individual, the children were hit by errant bullets. Henderson said there is no evidence that the gunfire was meant for the children.
""At this time, it is unknown who the intended target was,"" Henderson said.
NYPD Deputy Chief John Mastronardi, commanding officer of the Detective Borough Brooklyn North, said security video reviewed by detectives captured two gunmen entering the playground and both opening fire on the yet-to-be-identified individual, but ended up hitting the girls instead.
No arrests have been announced as of Tuesday afternoon and detectives asked for the public's help in identifying the gunmen.
Henderson said family members drove both girls to Brookdale Hospital.

A motive for the shooting remains under investigation.
""At this time, we're exploring multiple avenues of possible motives for this type of incident, but we're not going to rule out gang-related incidents that are problematic to this particular area of Brooklyn,"" Mastronnardi said.
He pointed out several pairs of shoes scattered on the playground, including those worn by the young victims.

Henderson said investigators recovered shell casings at the scene from two different caliber guns.
""Our detectives will be working diligently to apprehend the individuals responsible for this horrendous act of violence,"" Henderson said.
Several pairs of Crocs were left behind on a field at the Hilltop Playground in Brownsville, Brooklyn, including those worn by two children, ages 9 and 11, who were shot there on June 3, 2024.
WABC
Alexander had a message for the assailants who injured the children: ""Get a life.""
""There's so much more constructive things to do. You're putting children's lives at stake. Innocent children,"" Alexander said.
Parents and grandparents who frequent the park said the shooting left them worried for their children.
""I'm angry. I'm upset. I'm hurt because it's local children that are in this park all the time. I was in the park with my grandson, who is a year old,"" one resident told WABC, adding she knows one of the girls who was shot and saw her at the playground over the weekend.
The young victims are among 324 children 11 years old or younger who have been shot in incidents across the nation in the first five months of the year, including 94 who were killed, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a website that tracks all U.S. shootings.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-06-04,Google makes adjustments to AI Overviews after a rocky rollout,"The new search feature has delivered 'odd and erroneous' responses, Google said.","Google is making some changes to its AI Overviews, after the artificial intelligence-driven search feature gave what the company calls ""odd and erroneous"" responses to people's online searches.
AI Overviews were introduced last month at Google's annual I/O developer conference. Now, when people use Google Search to find information on certain topics, a box of AI-generated text appears at the top of the search results, annotated with links to external websites. Traditional search results appear below the AI Overviews, marking a major shift in how Google presents information.
According to a blog post from Google VP Liz Reid, AI Overviews results are generated using the company's large language model (LLM), Gemini, and are designed for instances when someone wants to ""get both a quick overview of a topic and links to learn more.""
Liz Reid, vice president, search, Google speaks during an event in New Delhi on Dec. 19, 2022.

Google technology expert Alex Joseph told ABC Audio that AI Overviews is able to field more complex questions than a traditional Google Search.
""With an AI Overview what [Google] can really do is synthesize a lot of information and get you the answer that you're looking for very quickly,"" said Joseph.
Instead of presenting users with pages of links to comb though, Joseph said, AI Overviews streamlines the process by summarizing information and providing users with a concise answer.
""They'll have less friction, they won't have to click through to a number of different websites, which can often be quite a bit of a bugbear if you just want some information very quickly,"" notes Chris Stokel-Walker, technology journalist and author of the book ""How AI Ate the World: A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence – and Its Long Future.""
MORE: Video -- Google announces product updates at its developers conference
However, Stokel-Walker said the new feature makes it harder for people using Google Search to verify the accuracy of the information they're reading.
""We've kind of got used to over the last two decades of Google Search dominance to the results that we get to a search term being largely right,"" he told ABC Audio. ""Suddenly, if you get rid of that, as Google is proposing, and actually just shove an answer straight into the search results page that its created via generative AI, you have no real way of identifying and kind of analyzing that information to see whether it's true or not.""
There are other concerns about the new feature as well. For one, generative AI technology, both from Google and elsewhere, has faced criticism for ""hallucinating"" – that is, generating information that's unreliable and inaccurate.
For example, in the few weeks since AI Overviews have been available to the public, people using Google Search have been advised to eat at least one small rock per day, and it told one user that a good way to get cheese to stick to pizza is to mix glue into the tomato sauce – both of which are, of course, very bad ideas. It also said that Andrew Jackson, the seventh U.S. president who died in 1845, graduated from college in 2005.
Stokel-Walker said any benefit from AI Overviews ultimately comes down to a tradeoff between convenience and cost. ""You no longer have kind of click through five or six different pages and maybe several pages of search results to find the right answer, but also it does mean that either the answer might be wrong or it might not be the one that you actually want to get,"" he said.

""We've always been very clear about the limitations of LLMs, that there will be occasionally hallucinations,"" Google's Alex Joseph said, adding that's why AI Overviews also cites the websites it uses to generate its answers.
""It's part of the reason that we present all of the information for you holistically,"" said Joseph. ""These are quick shortcuts to help you get some information to you quickly, but they're followed along with areas where you can go, double check, verify.""
Joseph also said not all queries are best served by an AI Overviews: ""We only show them on queries where we have a high confidence that it's going to be helpful and actually enhance the experience.""
MORE: Video Google announces product updates at its developers conference
In the wake of the unusual responses some social media users have reported, Google announced it had made ""more than a dozen technical improvements"" to AI Overviews. According to Liz Reid's blog post, they include limiting the inclusion of user-generated content, as well as satirical or humorous webpages, in the data used to craft AI Overviews. Reid said Google also ""launched additional triggering refinements to enhance our quality protections"" regarding health content, and that it ""aim[s] to not show AI Overviews for hard news topics, where freshness and factuality are important.""
The blog post also notes that ""AI Overviews generally don't 'hallucinate' or make things up in the ways that other LLM products might,"" and that the incorrect answers are the result of ""misinterpreting queries, misinterpreting a nuance of language on the web, or not having a lot of great information available.""
Aside from the accuracy concerns, Stokel-Walker said Google prioritizing AI Overviews over traditional search results could affect revenue and reshape how business is done on the web.
""Websites produce content; they try and make it attractive to Google. Google will show them in its search results. And as a result, people click through to their website, they then see ads off the back of that, and the publisher makes the money that allows them to put new content onto websites,"" Stokel-Walker explained.
By replacing the top of the Google Search results page with AI-generated content, however, Stokel-Walker said websites could see fewer visitors – and therefore less ad revenue.
It's an ironic situation, according to Stokel-Walker. That's because Gemini, the LLM Google uses to create its AI Overviews, relies on the websites it's now appearing ahead of.
""These websites do still need to exist, and they do need to have a way of making income, because otherwise, there's nothing for those AI-generated search results to be based on,"" Stokel-Walker pointed out.

In a statement to ABC News, Google said its testing has shown that the opposite is actually happening: that the links included in AI Overviews get more clicks than if the page had appeared as it typically does in search results. Google also said it will ""continue to focus"" on sending valuable traffic to publishers and creators.

Regardless of how the concerns about AI Overviews ultimately shake out, it's just one of a slew of features the company has planned for its line of technology products.
""I think that doing something like this as quickly as Google is doing it is concerning,"" said technology journalist C. Scott Brown of the website Android Authority.
Google has announced plans for additional features similar to AI Overviews, which will aim to answer questions about specific webpages or YouTube videos. Brown says those features will hit the market against the backdrop of increasing competition.
""And the reason it's doing that is because it feels like it has to. It has to keep up with companies – especially like OpenAI, for example – that are creating generative AI technologies that are threatening Google's core business, which is delivering information to people through Google search, and thus delivering them advertisements that allow Google to make billions and billions of dollars,"" said Brown.
""With Google seeing these things as a threat, it can't just rest. It can't figure out how to do this cleanly, and do it right,"" Brown added. ""It just has to do it.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Baskin, Louisiana, native and her meteoric rise to fame is the subject of a new ABC News Studios special, ""Lainey Wilson: Bell Bottom Country,"" streaming now on Hulu.

'Lainey Wilson: Bell Bottom Country' special to debut this month: Watch trailer here
The country music artist who was once told she's ""too country for country"" has been sweeping the awards -- including her first Grammy win in 2023 as well as entertainer of the year wins at both the CMA Awards and ACM Awards.
""I am a Grammy Award winner. I don't know if I'll ever get used to saying that one out loud,"" Wilson, who won best country album for ""Bell Bottom Country"" back in February, said in the special. ""It means a lot. It means a whole lot.""

Wilson also opened up about her visit to D.C. earlier this year to testify before Congress about the dangers of how artificial intelligence could be misused in the music industry.
""I'm very proud to have gone there,"" she said of the experience. ""I plan on doing whatever else I need to do to make sure that things actually get done about it.""
Wilson, along with her family, sat down with ""Good Morning America"" co-anchor Robin Roberts for the special to discuss the ups and downs she has experienced as one of the brightest stars in country music the past few years.
During their chat, the two discuss -- among other things -- Wilson's body image journey, filming the hit show ""Yellowstone"" while her father was facing health struggles and coming ""full circle"" to the Grand Ole Opry.
Wilson on her body image journey
Though Wilson calls herself ""a tough woman"" who can ""pull myself up by the bootstraps,"" she admits sometimes ""it's not easy.""
""I have my days, just like everybody else, where you got to do whatever you can to crawl out of those dark holes,"" she said.
One of those tough days came back in November of 2022 when Wilson said she was scrolling on TikTok and noticed ""a few videos of my butt that had gone viral."" Weeks went by and she only saw the online attention increase.

""I was like, 'Golly, it's still there.' It wasn't just like a small little viral moment,"" she recalled. ""It was a big -- no pun intended -- moment.""
Reflecting on how she brushed it off and found gratitude in people discovering her and her music no matter the means, Wilson told Roberts, ""First of all, I'm like, 'How'd y'all just notice that I got a big ol' butt? It's been back there the whole time.'""

The ""Things a Man Oughta Know"" singer said she reflected on how the greats of country music, women like Dolly Parton and Reba McEntire, would handle the situation.
""They'd laugh about it and they'd move on with it. That's just part of it,"" she noted. ""And, of course, don't go down the rabbit hole of looking at comments … I've learned my lesson with that.""
Wilson said it ""definitely has been"" frustrating to have her body scrutinized, saying, ""I'm not going to sit here and say that it has not just made me feel weird.""
""But at the end of the day, me gaining a few pounds or me losing a few pounds, it ain't got nothing to do with my story or me singing or my songwriting,"" she added. ""If you got a problem with that, turn off the radio 'cause you're gonna be hearing me on the radio.""
Wilson on filming 'Yellowstone' amid her dad's health battle
Part of Wilson's star rising in the music world was having a few of her songs featured on the hit series ""Yellowstone.""
""I think people knew some of the songs on the record. I think they knew my name. I think they knew what my voice kind of sounded like when it came on the radio,"" she said. ""But they didn't know me. Appearing on 'Yellowstone' put a face to a name.""
Years later, series creator Taylor Sheridan called wanting Wilson to join the show. Come season 5, she was playing Abby, a country singer who becomes a romantic interest for Ian Bohen's character Ryan.
Wilson, who admittedly had ""never acted a day in my life,"" said having the support of Sheridan and having someone of his pedigree see something in her become ""one of the most important things for my self-esteem.""

But just as this new door opened for Wilson, she faced a family emergency.
""When Lainey was shooting up to the top, we were having some major lows in our life,"" her mother, Michelle Wilson, said. ""My husband was diagnosed with mucormycosis, which most people don't live through.""

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mucormycosis is a rare but serious fungal infection caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes that mainly affects people with weakened immune systems and most commonly affects the sinuses or the lungs but can also occur on the skin after a cut, burn or another type of skin injury.
With this happening, Wilson said she didn't feel she could leave her dad's side -- but he had something to say about that.
""I said, 'If I'm supposed to be here, I'll be here. If I'm not, you come to my funeral,'"" Wilson's dad, Brian, recalled telling her at the time. ""I mean, it's hard to tell somebody to do that, but to me it was the right thing to do.""
So Wilson said she ""dried my tears and I hopped on a plane"" to film ""Yellowstone"" in Montana.
""I would do a line and I would go over to the corner and I'd cry, and then I'd come back and I'd do a line,"" she recalled of the experience.
""Of course my job is very, very important, but I still am a daughter and I think it was maybe life's way of keeping me grounded and reminding me what is most important,"" she added
Wilson on making it to the Opry
Wilson made her debut at the Grand Ole Opry, a place she said ""is where my dream got sparked,"" on Valentine's Day 2020.
""When I was 9 years old, I came to the Opry. Where I was sitting, I was looking at the stage, and I knew in that moment that I was supposed to be doing this,"" she said. ""And so, it's a full circle for me. It's a place that makes me feel at home.""

Since the filming of the special, Wilson has been invited to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry and will be inducted on June 7.

2024-05-24,'Killer clown' victim's son reflects on 33-year fight for justice,"After years of dead ends and long legal battles, Marlene Warren's son said he feels that he is at peace following the plea deal of the ""killer clown"" of Wellington.","Watch ABC News ""20/20"" tonight at 9:00 p.m. ET/8:00 p.m. CT for an encore presentation of this report, which first aired May 5, 2023.
For over 30 years, the ""killer clown"" has captivated investigators, Florida residents and true crime followers around the world.
Marlene Warren, a mother of two, was shot and killed in front of her son by a clown who approached her door and gave her balloons and flowers.
While the scary situation made headlines at the time, and remained a major unsolved mystery for a decade, Warren's son Joey Ahrens told ""20/20"" in an exclusive interview that it left a hole in his heart that has never been filled.
""She was a great mother,"" Joe Ahrens told ""20/20,"" in an exclusive interview. ""She was charismatic. She was a person of love.""

Ahrens' interview will be part of an extensive ""20/20"" airing Friday, May, 5 at 9 p.m. ET and streaming the next day on Hulu that looks at the 33-year-investigation.
Investigators announced a breakthrough in the case nearly six years ago saying new DNA evidence from mysterious hairs found in the getaway car and other clues directly pointed to Sheila Keen Warren, the second wife of Ahrens' stepfather. She pleaded guilty to second-degree murder last week.
""I never thought I was going to get a guilty [verdict],"" Ahtens told ""20/20"" after the sentencing. ""That was a shock. It just blew my mind.""
On May 26, 1990, Marlene Warren was at her Wellington, Florida, home with Ahrens, who was 21 at the time, and several of his friends, according to investigators. At the time, she was living with her second husband, Michael Warren, who ran a used car lot and a rental car agency.

Ahrens said that he, his friends and his mother saw a white Chrysler LeBaron pull into the driveway just before 11 a.m. that day and someone dressed as a clown came to the front door with flowers and balloons.
One of the balloons said, ""You're the Greatest,"" according to police.
""The last words I heard my mother say was, 'Oh, how pretty,' and bang,"" Ahrens said.
Investigators said Marlene Warren's killer gave her balloons and flowers while dressed as a clown before opening fire.
Palm Beach County's Sheriff's Office
The clown escaped in the car, according to witnesses, and Warren died in the hospital two days later.
In the immediate aftermath of the murder, police were able to track the stores where the balloons, flowers and clown costume were purchased and Deborah Offerman, a store employee, told investigators that she remembered selling the clown costume, wig and other accessories to a woman who came to the store right before closing.
""'I need to buy a costume,' And I said, 'Can you come back tomorrow? We're closed,'"" Offerman told ""20/20"" in a 2017 interview. ""'No, I really need this tonight. I need to get a costume tonight,'"" she said the customer told her.
Officers were alerted to an abandoned Chrysler LeBaron in a Winn-Dixie parking lot four days after the shooting. Inside they found what they called ""trace evidence,"" including what law enforcement officers described as artificial orange-like fibers, that could have come from a clown wig.

They also discovered what appeared to be long brown strands of human hair, which would later be crucial to the case.
DNA analysis at the time wasn’t as advanced, and relevant DNA couldn’t be taken from hair.
Although Michael Warren was questioned by the police, he had an alibi as he was on his way to a Miami racetrack with friends at the time of the shooting. He denied having any involvement in the murder.
Friends and family told police that Michael Warren may have been having an affair with his employee Sheila Keen, who was a repossession agent.

Investigators did question Keen and Michael Warren about the affair but they both denied it.
The costume shop employees identified Keen Warren to the police as the woman who purchased the clown suit. Cops searched her home, but found no evidence to warrant an arrest.
Keen and Michael Warren would get married in 2002 and settle in Virginia, unbeknownst to most of their Florida friends and family. In the meantime, investigators could not find any more leads in the case.
Ahrens said the pain of his mother's death and that his family didn't get justice led him into a depression and alcohol addiction.
Eventually, he entered rehab and said his mental health has improved.

""I broke down, and I said, 'Enough is enough, I can't do this on my own,'"" he said.
The case started to pick up traction in 2013 when new prosecutor Reid Scott revisited the forensic evidence found during the initial investigation.
Scott ordered that the hairs be tested using mitochondrial DNA analysis, which he told ""20/20"" is a ""type of analysis that is conducted typically on older samples.""
The more advanced analysis determined that the hair matched Keen Warren, according to investigators.
She would be arrested and extradited to Florida in Oct. 2017, charged with first-degree murder of Marlene Warren.
Michael Warren wasn't charged.

For five years, Keen Warren waited in jail for her trial to begin, as her attorney Greg Rosenfeld maintained her innocence and questioned the prosecutors' case.
Rosenfeld told ""20/20"" that he questioned the validity of DNA evidence and analysis, given that it was in storage for so long.
He also noted that Aherns and other witnesses initially claimed that the clown appeared to be a man.
""A clown costume does not disguise your gender. You can tell if a clown's a man or a woman, even with makeup on,"" he said.
Scott, however, reiterated the clues added up.
""Yes, it's circumstantial evidence, but an overwhelming amount of circumstantial evidence,"" he said.

In the meantime, Ahrens said he was sure that Keen Warren would face justice.
""Sheila Keen-Warren was the murderer of my mother. I was there, I saw her eyes. And I'll tell you. They're the eyes. I'll never forget them,"" he said.
But a few weeks before the trial was set to begin, Keen Warren made a shocking announcement -- she was going to make a plea deal with prosecutors.
The deal, which was announced on April 25, had Keen Warren plead guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for a 12-year sentence. Rosenfeld said that her five and a half years in custody would count towards that sentence and she could be released next year on good behavior.

""The defendant is pleading guilty because she's guilty and a factual basis does exist for the crime,"" Scott said.
Ahrens appeared via a video conference at the plea hearing and told the judge he accepted the conditions, but noted that he never once saw remorse from Keen Warren.
""My final conclusion was, I was going to be at peace with the outcome,"" he said. ""Guilty or not, I was going to be okay.""

A few days after the plea deal was finalized, Ahrens visited his mother's grave to give her a message.
""I was telling her we finally got truth. We finally got closure,"" he said.

2024-05-24,Review: 'The Garfield Movie' feels like a cynical cash grab,"Film critic Peter Travers shares his review of ""The Garfield Movie,"" which is out in theaters now.","It’s hard out there for family audiences. First the quality deficit of last week’s ""IF"" and now the further descent of ""The Garfield Movie,"" only in theaters and probably your first destination choice for kids over the Memorial holiday weekend. What a bummer.
This misbegotten misfire looks to score at the box office until dire word of mouth kills it. Why the letdown? ""The Garfield Movie"" is brand marketing from filmmakers who don’t even bother to hide the blatant product placement. Lacking inspiration and perspiration, this despairingly off-kilter toon looks like a movie, talks like a movie, but feels like a cynical cash grab.
Scene from ""The Garfield Movie.""
Sony Pictures
All the elements are there. It’s an outdoor adventure for everyone’s favorite indoor cat. There’s Chris Pratt voicing Garfield, the tubby orange tabby who hates Mondays and loves lasagna. Samuel L. Jackson does the honors for his cool cat dad Vic.
What goes wrong? Start with the basic idea. Gone is the deadpan sarcasm of the comic strip that Jim Davis started in 1978 and continued in a syndicated TV series. The casual putdowns that Bill Murray built into two ""Garfield"" live-action movies from the aughts is also MIA.

""The Garfield Movie,"" soon to be infamous for its bad decisions, turns the mouthy, shamelessly lazy Garfield into an action hero, voiced by Pratt with an energetic whoosh you hear in his Mario in ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie."" What the whoosh is doing here defies understanding.
Scene from ""The Garfield Movie.""
Sony Pictures
After a prologue showing Garfield abandoned as a kitten by dad Vic and adopted into a cushy life by the human and humane Jon Arbuckle (Nicholas Hoult), Garfield is off to the mischief races with Jon’s not-too-bright dog Odie (Harvey Guillén does the barks and whimpers).
In no time, Garfield and Odie are kidnapped by the feline Jinx (Hannah Waddingham), a criminal crony of Vic’s who blames him for botching a milk heist that sent her to the pound. Having escaped, Jinx forces Vic, Garfield and Odie into a second robbery that intensifies the risk.
It’s doubtful that creator Davis and Garfield fans of the last half century would recognize the over-caffeinated kitty in these generic pyrotechnics directed by Mark Dindal (""The Emperor’s New Groove,"" ""Chicken Little""). ""I do my own stunts,"" brags Garfield, ""me and Tom Cruise.""
So there goes smartphone junkie Garfield (the better to order food), zipping around like a speed demon on a mission impossible that Cruise himself would envy as the tabby bends back a tree branch like a slingshot to shoot himself through the air and onto a speeding train.
Scene from ""The Garfield Movie.""
Sony Pictures
Yikes! Who is this super kittycat? Did you ever imagine sleepyhead Garfield mixing it up with Jinx and her doggie criminal peeps, Roland (Brett Goldstein) and Nolan (Bowen Yang). It’s a wonder they didn’t put Garfield in a mask and pass him off as a Marvel superhero.
Credit the movie with tugging at the heartstrings by reuniting Garfield and his daddy. But the script by Paul A. Kaplan, Mark Torgove and David Reynolds feels like like artificial intelligence cobbled it together from other, better movies (think ""The Secret Life of Pets"").
Nowhere to be seen is the cat who made a joke out of casual indifference. To enjoy ""The Garfield Movie,"" it will help to be five years old or under, though even the toddler set is likely to cough up this recycled 101-minute hairball and move on. I suggest you do the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-05-21,Urgent warning on the impact of AI on 2024 election,The Department of Homeland Security says the technology offers opportunities for bad actors to undermine our democratic system.,"Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.

2024-05-21,Scarlett Johansson reacts to OpenAI using similar voice to hers as org 'pauses' Sky voice,Scarlett Johansson is speaking out about the use of a similar voice to hers on OpenAI's new ChatGPT system.,"Scarlett Johansson is speaking out after OpenAI announced on Sunday that it would be pausing the use of an emotive voice on its newest version of ChatGPT that sounded like the actress.
In a statement from Johansson’s publicist to ABC Audio, the actress detailed how she was approached by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to voice the ChatGPT 4.0 system, how she declined and how she discovered that a voice on the new system sounded like her voice.

“Last September, I received an offer from Sam Altman, who wanted to hire me to voice the current ChatGPT 4.0 system,” Johansson began in her statement. “He told me that he felt that by my voicing the system, I could bridge the gap between tech companies and creatives and help consumers to feel comfortable with the seismic shift concerning humans and AI. He said he felt that my voice would be comforting to people.”
“After much consideration and for personal reasons, I declined the offer,” she continued. “Nine months later, my friends, family and the general public all noted how much the newest system named ‘Sky’ sounded like me,” her statement continued.
“When I heard the released demo, I was shocked, angered and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference,” said Johansson, who went on to say that Altman’s use of the voice was “intentional” and a reference to her character in the 2013 film “Her,” in which Johansson voices the chat system, Samantha.
“Mr. Altman even insinuated that the similarity was intentional, tweeting a single word 'her' -- a reference to the film in which I voiced a chat system, Samantha, who formed a relationship with a human,” Johansson said, referencing Altman’s May 13 message on X, formerly known as Twitter, which fueled more questions about the voice’s origins. “Two days before the ChatGPT 4.0 demo was released, Mr. Altman contacted my agent, asking me to reconsider. Before we could connect, the system was out there.”
“As a result of their actions, I was forced to hire legal counsel, who wrote two letters to Mr. Altman and OpenAI, setting out what they had done and asking them to detail the exact process by which they created the ‘Sky’ voice,” she continued. “Consequently, OpenAI reluctantly agreed to take down the ‘Sky’ voice.”
OpenAI also shared a blog post detailing how the voices for ChatGPT were chosen through an ""extensive process spanning five months involving professional voice actors, talent agencies, casting directors, and industry advisors"" and how it believes that the voices “should not deliberately mimic a celebrity’s distinctive voice.”
It also said that Sky’s voice is ""not an imitation of Scarlett Johansson, but belongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice."" OpenAI did not release the name of the actress voicing Sky nor the other actors for the other voices of the system to ""protect their privacy.""
Johansson ended her statement by addressing the larger conversation around artificial intelligence and privacy as a whole.

“In a time when we are all grappling with deepfakes and the protection of our own likeness, our own work, our own identities, I believe these are questions that deserve absolute clarity,” she said. “I look forward to resolution in the form of transparency and the passage of appropriate legislation to help ensure that individual rights are protected.”
In response to Johansson’s statement, Altman released his own, saying Open AI is ""sorry"" they ""didn't communicate better.""
“The voice of Sky is not Scarlett Johansson's, and it was never intended to resemble hers,” Altman said. “We cast the voice actor behind Sky’s voice before any outreach to Ms. Johansson.”
“Out of respect for Ms. Johansson, we have paused using Sky’s voice in our products,” he added. “We are sorry to Ms. Johansson that we didn’t communicate better.”

2024-05-21,Is it too late to join the bull market? Experts weigh in.,The blazing hot stock market seems to set new records just about every day.,"The blazing hot stock market seems to set new records just about every day.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average stands above 40,000 for the first time in history, after climbing nearly 20% since October. Over that period, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have each soared even higher, climbing 23% and 27% respectively.
The market rally means a windfall for people with stock holdings but it poses a quandary for those on the sidelines: Is it time to jump in or too late to reap the gains?
Experts who spoke to ABC News encouraged investors to take advantage of the market upswing, saying the major indexes have room to rise even further.

The confidence stems from the nation’s sunny economic outlook, they added, as the Federal Reserve stands poised to make interest rate cuts that could boost an already robust economy. However, they cautioned, stubborn inflation or an economic downturn could bring losses.
""This is a pretty awesome environment to own stocks in right now,"" Tom Essaye, president of financial data firm Sevens Report Research, told ABC News. ""There is still time to get in.""
The economy is performing well on many key metrics. Unemployment stands near a 65-year low, while economic growth has remained solid and consumer spending has shown resilience.
All of these positive indicators have added up to strong corporate profits, the lifeblood of the stock market. ""Growth is good and corporate earnings are good,"" Essaye said.
Strong stock market performance, however, depends on where company results and economic output are headed rather than where they stand at the present time, experts said.
Fortunately, many observers hold an optimistic outlook about the coming months, since the Fed appears to be on the verge of interest rate cuts that could deliver a jolt to the economy.
In recent months, the Fed had all but abandoned its previous forecast of three quarter-point rate cuts this year. But a slowdown of price hikes offered hope of rekindling those plans.
Inflation data released last week showed that price increases slowed slightly from the annual rate recorded in the previous month, ending a surge of inflation that stretched back to the beginning of 2024.
""Front and center is what the Fed is going to do,"" Marc Dizard, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group. ""There is a bias here that they want to cut rates, which the market is really liking.""
Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference at the Federal Reserve in Washington, May 1, 2024.

Optimism about the stock market also owes to enthusiasm about the impact of artificial intelligence, experts said.
Major stock indexes drew a bump in recent months from investors favorable toward the newly prominent technology. Those gains were concentrated primarily in a handful of tech giants, known as the so-called ""Magnificent 7"": Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia.
Shares of Nvidia have climbed nearly 120% since October; Microsoft has jumped almost 35% over that period.
Ed Yardeni, the president of market advisory firm Yardeni Research and former chief investment strategist at Deutsche Bank's U.S. equities division, said adoption of AI in the coming months and years would help grow the economy and send the stock market higher.
""The market is right to get excited about technological innovations like artificial intelligence, robotics and automation,"" Yardeni said. ""I think those technologies will boost productivity and productivity boosts real economic growth.""
Dizard, of PNC, said the stock market retains the capacity to rise between 5% and 8%. While Essaye, of Sevens Report Research, said the S&P 500 could increase another 3% or more.
Meanwhile, Yardeni offered a longer-term view, saying he expects the major stock indexes to climb 50% by 2030.
Still, the experts warned of potential outcomes that could not only blunt future gains but incur significant losses.

Stubborn inflation could force the Fed to shift its posture, holding rates elevated for longer than expected or even raising them altogether.
""You could see a curveball,"" Dizard said. ""That’s something investors need to be cautious about.""
Some economic indicators, meanwhile, have already shown signs of a slowdown. The labor market has continued to add jobs this year but at a slower pace than 2023. The economy grew at the outset of 2024 but cooled off from the final stretch of last year.
""An economic slowdown is the number one thing everybody has to worry about,"" Essaye said, predicting that such an outcome could bring a market decline of 10% or more.
Even after noting risks, Dizard struck a positive note. ""There is momentum to the upside,"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-05-21,2 largest AI companies to debut latest skills,ABC News contributor Mike Muse drops by to talk about the latest developments from Google and OpenAI.,"Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement.

2024-05-21,UCLA class using AI to have a more engaged classroom,UCLA professor uses AI to teach his students and grade their comprehension.,"Students enrolled in Prof. Daniel Nathanson's business class at UCLA do not take tests or pore over books. They are not immersed in the usual 40-page case studies that often dictate the curriculum.
Instead, Nathanson has help from an AI tool to enhance interaction in his classroom. The tool gets students through real-life business scenarios in small groups, offers individualized quizzes, and leads group discussions on big business concepts.
Nathanson, the first college professor to use the Breakout Learning AI tool, says the software is used both to prevent students from using generative AI to cheat, and is incorporated into the lesson to ensure the students' comprehension of the material.
Students at UCLA learn business from AI.
ABC News
""It enabled me to say where they need a level set, where they are and adjust my lecture to meet their needs,"" Nathanson said of the learning tool, which is now used at more than 100 universities, including Yale, Cornell and MIT.
Nathanson says he plugs in what he wants the AI to teach the students.
When asked, none of the students thought AI's grading was better than that of humans. Nathanson also doesn't use the scores from AI when calculating final grades, but only as a way to assess their comprehension of the course material.
The business scenarios, voiced by actors, bring to life the experiences of corporate leaders like former Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh, who died in 2020, and his team, making the learning experience truly immersive and relevant.

""We want to lift up the idea of small group discussion as the primary format for learning,"" said Ramit Varma, who, along with Steven Walters, founded Breakout Learning. ""We've been learning in small group formats for thousands of years.""
Breakout Learning transcribes the spoken words and then runs it through OpenAI, which generates a summary and matches it against a grading rubric to determine an individual engagement score and two group performance scores.

The company's website emphasizes using AI for grading and facilitating conversations, claiming it can simplify the former.
In one experiment, educators and the owners of Breakout Learning went through the course with the students during a test to evaluate the grading system. One student, Georgia, was engaged, collaborative and considerate of her colleagues. It seemed clear that she would rank among the highest scores.
However, she ranked near the lowest.

""That particular student scored the highest in group; what they saw was an engagement score, which was actually a misfire in the software that actually is not the actual metric that we use to measure quality,"" Walters said.
Breakout Learning stated that after observing the session with the students, they completely removed this specific scoring system. They are now focusing solely on comprehension scores rather than engagement.
While questions linger about using AI as a grading tool, the students still support the program.

""Thus far into its development, probably a B+,"" Georgia said, grading the software. ""There's always room for improvement. AI again is very new. We're just seeing the beginnings of something great.""
A USC professor agrees with the students and believe that in the next decade UCLA won't be an anomaly. They think most classrooms in America will use some form of artificial intelligence. Other educators, however, believe AI needs to be thoroughly tested before being used as a main teaching tool in classrooms.
""If I'm a student, and I'm like, 'well, computers just going to grade me,' then am I going to put forth 100% of my effort?"" said USC Associate Professor Stephen Aguilar. ""Or am I going to use some other AI to basically talk to their AI so it just becomes an AI talking to AI? And I think that that's one of the dangers of doing too quickly without really understanding or figuring out what our values are relative to new AI technologies.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis, compiled by the Department of Homeland Security and obtained by ABC News, outlines how, with less than six months before Election Day, next-generation technologies meant to fuel advancement also offer opportunities for misuse that could threaten the democratic system's bedrock of elections.
""As the 2024 election cycle progresses, generative AI tools likely provide both domestic and foreign threat actors with enhanced opportunities for interference by aggravating emergent events, disrupting election processes, or attacking election infrastructure,"" the May 17 document said.

Already, those attempting to target elections have done so ""by conducting cyber-enabled hack-and-leak campaigns, voice spoofing, online disinformation campaigns, and threatening or plotting attacks against symbols of the US elections,"" the bulletin said.

On the eve of the New Hampshire primary in January, a robocall seeming to impersonate the voice of President Joe Biden circulated, encouraging recipients of the call to ""save your vote"" for the November general election, rather than participate in the state's primary, according to audio obtained at the time by ABC News.
That ""generative AI-created audio message"" was specifically flagged in the DHS analysis, which also noted ""the timing of election-specific AI-generated media can be just as critical as the content itself, as it may take time to counter-message or debunk the false content permeating online.""
""This may be one of the most difficult elections for Americans to navigate finding ground truth in our lifetimes,"" said Elizabeth Neumann, a DHS assistant secretary during the first years of Donald Trump's presidency, and now an ABC News contributor. ""It's not just whether a politician is telling you the truth, but you won't even be able to trust your own eyes at the images you're seeing in your social media feeds, in your email and possibly even traditional media, if they don't do a good enough job vetting the material.""
The 2024 race has been marked by increasingly toxic rhetoric, and the intermingling of inflammatory campaign trail hyperbole and courtroom theatrics, as Trump faces four criminal cases in which he maintains his innocence. Hate speech, misinformation and disinformation are running rampant on social media and in real life -- even as rapidly evolving technology remains vulnerable, experts said. Meanwhile, wars in the Middle East and Ukraine continue overseas, dividing Americans' views on foreign policy, with the conflicts rippling out in protests at major U.S. college campuses from coast to coast.

""Threat actors can attempt to exploit deepfake videos, audio content, or other generative AI media to amplify discontent,"" the DHS analysis said. ""A well-timed deepfake or piece of AI-generated media for a targeted audience could spur individuals to take action that may result in violence or physical disruptions directed toward the elections or candidates.""
The threat landscape has grown ""more diverse and more complex,"" and protecting the integrity of U.S. elections faces more challenges than ever due to the accelerating sophistication of artificial intelligence, top intelligence officials told lawmakers last Wednesday.
""Using every tool we have is critical as the challenge is expanding,"" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told a Senate committee holding a hearing focused on threats to the 2024 elections. ""There are an increasing number of foreign actors, including non-state entities who are looking to engage in election influence activities,"" she said, adding ""relevant emerging technologies, particularly generative AI and big data analytics, are increasing the threat by enabling the proliferation of influence actors who can conduct targeted campaigns.""

""Innovations in AI have enabled foreign influence actors to produce seemingly authentic and tailored messaging more efficiently, at greater scale,"" Haines added. ""Even as the threat landscape is becoming increasingly complicated, it is my view that the U.S. government has never been better prepared to address the challenge,"" in part thanks to lessons learned from the 2016 presidential election.
Authorities at every level need to be ready to defend against artificial intelligence disseminating fake news at this delicate moment, experts said.
""One of the most important things we need to be doing now is educating and preparing the public. Because they will be the people who are being targeted with this content -- the public is the intended target -- and the objective is to influence how people behave,"" Cohen said.
""State and local officials need to have a plan, so that when this content is detected, they can use trusted sources of communication to counteract and correct inaccurate information. Once that content hits, it's going to spread across the online media ecosystem rapidly, and has to be counteracted immediately,"" Cohen added. ""Law enforcement and our security community have been slow to adapt to this rapidly evolving threat environment. We're still using the strategies of yesterday to deal with a threat of today. In a way, it's bringing a knife to a gunfight.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,"NCAA: 1 in 3 star athletes receive abuse, threats by bettors",요약 없음,"One in three high-profile athletes receive abusive messages from individuals with a ""betting interest,"" and more than 540 men's and women's college basketball players received similar abuse, including death threats, during championship tournaments in March, the NCAA said in a release Friday.
The NCAA looked at athletes participating in sports that attract the most betting interest -- football and basketball, among others -- and found that online abuse is widespread. Signify, an artificial intelligence company and NCAA partner, covered 1,000 Division I men's and women's college basketball players, 64 teams, more than 200 coaches and 120 NCAA game officials during March Madness. The analysis, which is part of an NCAA initiative aimed at combating online abuse and harassment, found 4,000 posts or comments that were confirmed to be abusive or threatening during March Madness.
The NCAA said the data showed women's basketball players received approximately three times more overall threats than men's players and that 15-25% of abuse directed at players, coaches and officials who are involved in the most popular college sports was related to betting.
""Individuals who harass athletes, amateur or professional, over a sports bet should not be tolerated,"" Joe Maloney, senior vice president of strategic communications for the American Gaming Association, told ESPN in a statement. ""Importantly, the legal sports wagering market is providing the transparency critical to discuss solutions to reducing player harassment for the first time -- an opportunity illegal market actors do not provide. We look forward to continuing our dialogue with the NCAA, professional leagues, and other stakeholders on the universal shared goal of reducing athlete harassment.""
In March, Armando Bacot, a forward on the North Carolina men's basketball team, told reporters he received dozens of direct messages on social media criticizing him for his performance in the Tar Heels' win over Michigan State in the second round of the NCAA tournament.
""It's terrible,"" Bacot said. ""Even at the last game, I guess I didn't get enough rebounds or something. I thought I played pretty good last game, but I looked at my DMs, and I got like over 100 messages from people telling me I sucked and stuff like that because I didn't get enough rebounds.""
The data released coincides with the NCAA's efforts to ban sportsbooks from offering prop betting on college players. Prop betting includes wagers such as the over/under on a player's points or rebounds. Ohio, Louisiana, Maryland and Vermont have passed recent legislation banning prop betting on college players, and more states are considering the issue.
Joe Brennan, a longtime internet gaming consultant and now executive director for online sportsbook Prime Sports, believes the NCAA is looking at the issue ""from the wrong end of the telescope.""
""This is a social media problem first and foremost,"" Brennan said. ""The NCAA demanding the banning of college player props is a distraction from the root causes and likely solutions. Abusive speech towards teams and players is a sad reality in competitive sports. ... It's unfortunate that sports betting has now also become another subject in this, but it certainly didn't start it.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-05-17,"'Overlooked' workers who train AI can face harsh conditions, advocates say","Millions of workers worldwide help assemble vast amounts of training data, and can often face harsh conditions, advocates say.","Krystal Kauffman, a gig worker, spent one workday watching footage captured by a camera that had been placed on a baby's head, labeling objects as they came into view, she said. For another job, she said she looked at images of feet, while on another, she marked aerial photographs of animals.
Over nearly a decade, Kauffman has performed thousands of tiny tasks that have helped companies assemble the immense data sets used to train artificial intelligence (AI), she said.
""It's supposed to look like these products are magic,"" Kauffman, who performs tasks on the platform Amazon Mechanical Turk and advocates for workers as a lead organizer for the group Turkopticon, told ABC News. ""People don't know that behind all of this is a workforce – a human workforce.""
AI has reshaped everything from medical diagnoses, to wedding vows, to stock market gains, but the technology wouldn't be possible without gig workers across the globe, like Kauffman.

However, analysts and advocates said the workers whose efforts help train AI are often denied knowledge of the end product they help create, or the company behind it. They also risk rejection of their work after it has been completed, which can leave them without pay or recourse to collect it.
""If we want to build a better society, we can't ignore the tens of millions of people who are doing this work,"" Sonam Jindal told ABC News. Jindal is the lead of AI, labor and the economy at the Partnership on AI, a coalition of AI organizations. ""If they're overlooked and facing precarious conditions, that's a problem,"" she said.
To mimic human discernment, AI products typically use an algorithm that responds to queries based on lessons learned from scanning a large quantity of text, images or video. An AI tool that helps doctors diagnose cancer, for instance, may train on digital copies of CT scans.
The training material, however, oftentimes must first be curated by human workers, who make the content legible for an AI model, Jindal said.
""AI models don't know on their own how to distinguish between cats and dogs, whether or not someone has cancer or not, whether something is a stop sign or not,"" Jindal explained. ""People are very heavily involved in building these datasets.""
A worldwide gig workforce began to swell a decade ago, in part to complete such AI-related tasks, according to a report published in 2021 by Open Research Europe. Roughly 14 million workers have obtained work through online platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk and Upwork, the study found, which operate as go-betweens for freelance workers and tech firms.
Many of those global workers live in the U.S. Roughly 96% of workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk, for example, log in from the U.S., according to data site MTurk Tracker.
Krystal Kauffman, a gig worker, said she often works on projects without an understanding of the end product or the company behind it.

Online gig workers in the U.S. retain flexible schedules, but their tasks carry many of the key characteristics of a ""bad job,"" Matt Beane, an assistant professor in the Technology Management Program at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told ABC News.
""A bad job basically is one that doesn't give you a lot of autonomy around what you get to do,"" Beane said. ""In other words, you don't feel like there's a meaningful connection between what you're doing and some valuable output in the world.""
The lack of meaning stems in part from the mundane nature of the tasks, and the dearth of information provided to freelance workers about the product being developed or the company making it, Jindal said.
""Transparency is a huge problem,"" Jindal said. ""This partially has to do with a very utilitarian approach to building AI models. People will say, 'I just need the data.'""
""It gets passed on to someone else who may not have the full context,"" Jindal added.
In addition to a lack of clarity about the final product, the AI gig workers run the risk of what they refer to as ""mass rejection,"" which is when a company declines a batch of work after it has been completed.
In such cases, a worker both loses out on pay and lacks a means for appealing the judgment, Kauffman said, while the company keeps the data the worker produced. Sometimes, she added, companies offering work on Amazon Mechanical Turk reject the data without cause, and change their username as a means of avoiding accountability.

Workers consequently not only lose out on the immediate income, but they also suffer a blow to their approval rating on the platform, which determines the quality of work made available to them, Kauffman said.
""So the more rejections you have, the worse your approval rating gets,"" Kauffman explained. ""Something like that can take away a person's entire livelihood.""
In response to ABC News' request for comment, Amazon said Mechanical Turk monitors for mass rejections and takes appropriate action if they encounter them, up to and including suspension.
The average rejection rate on the platform is less than 1%, Amazon added. Further, the company said it has a Participation Agreement and an Acceptable Use Policy to ensure there is no abuse in the marketplace by either those requesting work, or those agreeing to do tasks.
In her work for Turkopticon, Kauffman and other workers put pressure on Amazon to improve the conditions for the AI gig workforce, she said. The explosion in the popularity of AI products, she added, has generated a surge in public attention around the challenges such workers face.
""It just feels like the power is building and the awareness is building,"" Kauffman said. ""It's this incredible feeling.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-05-17,Whistleblower claims EPA wasted critical time after devastating Ohio train derailment,Whistleblower claims EPA wasted critical time after devastating Ohio train derailment.,"An Environmental Protection Agency whistleblower told ABC News the United States EPA wasted critical time gathering data in the days immediately following the catastrophic derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine, Ohio, last year.
Senior research scientist Robert Kroutil alleged the EPA delayed days in deploying one of its most effective tools in assessing chemical incidents: The Airborne Spectral Photometric Environmental Collection Technology (ASPECT) plane.
Kroutil helped develop the EPA's ASPECT plane – a one-of-one specialized aircraft equipped with radiological and infrared sensors. He had been part of the project since 1984, writing its software and helping interpret its data.
ABC News obtained a sworn affidavit submitted as part of a complaint by the Government Accountability Project requesting an EPA investigation. In that affidavit, Kroutil said since 2001 the aircraft has responded to nearly 180 chemical incident missions including Gulf oil spills and hurricanes.
According to Kroutil, the ASPECT plane is able to identify 78 different compounds using artificial intelligence and collects data allowing scientists to identify another 530 compounds by hand. These compounds include vinyl chloride and many of the VOC's independent scientists have tested for since the derailment.
The Government Accountability Project, which represents Kroutil, is now requesting a formal investigation into the use of the EPA's APSECT plane.

The aircraft, which is based near Dallas, has a dedicated crew that can scramble to have the single-engine Cessna in the air within an hour of a disaster alert.
In a statement to ABC News, EPA detailed that it requested the plane late in the day on Feb. 5, 2023 -- two days after the Feb. 3 crash -- when dozens of train cars derailed, 11 of them containing hazardous material. The wreckage burned and forced hundreds of people from their homes. The ASPECT aircraft began flying over East Palestine on Feb. 7, 2023.

""It was very unusual,"" Kroutil told ABC News. ""When I saw a news feed, I wondered why the plane would not be deployed to this particular type of accident because of the technology on the airplane and being able to assess the situation immediately.""
Kroutil insists the plane could have provided first responders critical information, that would have indicated it wasn't necessary to blow open five tank cars and burn the vinyl chloride inside. He says the plane's sensors would have detected the cars' temperatures more accurately than the responders on the ground who were having trouble safely getting close enough to check.
The EPA refuted Kroutil's claims of a delayed deployment, calling them ""false"" in a statement to ABC News. The agency also cited weather conditions caused a delay for the ASPECT aircraft.

""EPA Region 5 requested ASPECT to fly to East Palestine late in the day on February 5, 2023. As soon as the request was made, the aircraft was deployed the same day from its home base in Addison, Texas to Pittsburgh. Due to low ceilings and icing conditions, the flight crew made the determination that the aircraft was unable to fly safely on February 6, 2023, the day of the controlled burn. Weather conditions were favorable for data collection on February 7, 2023, and the aircraft conducted two flight missions, providing the information it was requested to collect consistent with previous ASPECT responses.""
The EPA told ABC News its responders were on-scene within hours of the derailment, establishing a robust air monitoring network at the site of the crash and within the community. They said the ASPECT plane is just one component of a comprehensive air monitoring and sampling network.

However, Kroutil also alleged there were other key inconsistencies with the EPA's response. According to him, when the ASPECT aircraft did fly over East Palestine, it only gathered eight minutes' worth of data. A normal operation, he told ABC News, would involve hundreds of minutes of data collection. Thus, he and his team labeled their findings incomplete. However, according to the affidavit, the EPA managers changed the report to declare their controlled release successful because the plane found so few chemicals. ABC News has not independently verified these reports.
""It was very worrying based on what I looked at in the data, but it took me a while to assess that,"" he said. ""I just analyzed the data and it is what it is.""
Kroutil says he and the contractor he worked for, Kalman and Company, complained. He says he sent emails and monthly reports outlining deficiencies in the data and never got a response. He also claims on June 1, 2023 he wrote a FOIA request asking about a government quality assurance plan. He left his job in late January over frustrations with the East Palestine assessment.
Kroutil told ABC News, ""I believe that EPA has no deployment model. They don't know how to use technology.""
""The contractor mentioned was not part of the ASPECT flight crew responsible for the determination of flight safety. EPA does not comment on internal personnel matters relating to contractors,"" a spokesperson for EPA told ABC News.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a significant and symbolic milestone for the index that tracks 30 of the most valuable publicly traded companies in the U.S.
The Dow is now up about 6% so far this year.
By the end of trading on Thursday, the Dow had fallen below 40,000. The index closed at 39,869.38, which marked a slight decline for the day.
MORE: Interest rates may stay high for longer. Here’s what it means for the 2024 election.
The recent rally in the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq has been fueled by data showing inflation is cooling, which would allow the Federal Reserve to begin its long-awaited interest rate cuts.
Inflation data released on Wednesday showed that price increases slowed slightly from the annual rate recorded in the previous month, ending a surge of inflation that stretches back to the beginning of 2024.
In recent months, the Fed had all but abandoned its previous forecast of three quarter-point rate cuts this year. But the slowdown of price hikes offered hope of rekindling those plans.
""The combination of the Fed likely to be lowering interest rates because inflation is moderating with a resilient economy is a beautiful scenario for a bull market,"" Ed Yardeni, the president of market advisory firm Yardeni Research and former chief investment strategist at Deutsche Bank's U.S. equities division, told ABC News.

The inflation news on Wednesday sent each of the major stock indexes up more than 5% for the day, propelling all of them to record highs. In early trading on Thursday, the Dow had ticked up a quarter of a percentage point.

They said the recommendations are a critical step as Congress considers legislation to increase innovation and safeguard against negative uses of the rapidly-evolving technology.
The document called for a hefty increase in funding for AI innovation to be worked into Congress' annual funding process -- funding to the tune of $32 billion over several years, an amount recommended by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
That money, Schumer said during a news conference will help to ""cement America's dominance in AI.""

Schumer said that separate funding, perhaps additional billions, will likely also be needed in coming years to address defense and national security concerns related to artificial intelligence.
""Congress faced a momentous choice: We could either watch from the sidelines as AI reshape our world or make a novel earnest bipartisan effort to harness and regulate this industry,"" Schumer said. ""We knew if we did nothing real problems could merge in terms of the lack of maximizing the benefits of AI and the lack of minimizing the detriments of AI.""
He said he'll strive to make the effort not only bipartisan but bicameral and that he would soon meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson to discuss AI policy. Schumer said he thinks Johnson is ""very interested"" in moving forward.

The working group of senators has been focused on artificial intelligence in recent months and it includes Schumer, Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D, and Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M.
Before releasing the ""roadmap"" Wednesday, the group convened a series of ""AI insight forums"" over the last several months that featured high-profile names in tech as well as stakeholders across a number of industries. More than 150 experts participated across the nine forums.
The document is the end result of that work. It does not include legislative text, but is meant to help inform lawmakers as they continue to grapple with how best to pass legislation to reign in artificial intelligence. Senate committees have been holding hearings on a number of AI topics relevant to their specific committees and the document encourages the continuation of those discussions.
""We always knew we would have to go to the committees to get the specifics done. There's so many different aspects of AI in so many different areas, that it would take many committees to do it,"" Schumer said. ""We are very now hopeful that the bipartisan momentum that we fostered and the recommendations we made will extend into the committees and their process.""

MORE: Schumer unveils new AI framework as Congress wades into regulatory space
There are a vast number of policy priorities that committees can seize upon, and Schumer said he's hopeful some AI-oriented legislation will be approved by the Senate before the year is out. The Senate, Schumer said, will advance AI legislation as it is ready, and will not wait for a massive package of AI bills to be voted on at one time.
In a major boon to that effort, the Senate Rules Committee on Wednesday advanced several pieces of bipartisan legislation aimed at safeguarding elections from challenges posed by artificial intelligence, including a bill that would ban the use of AI to generate ""materially deceptive content"" depicting federal candidates.
These so-called ""deepfakes"" are a focus of the bipartisan report released Wednesday. In addition to backing efforts to regulate fake content concerning elections, the senators also identify a need to regulate destruction of ""non-consensual"" ""intimate"" images generated on AI. This issue came into particular focus in January when a sexually explicit AI-generated images of Taylor Swift made the rounds on the internet.
Senators also highlighted in the report the need to consider how to create a federal data privacy framework, how to lead in the adoption of these new technologies in a way that will build up national security, and how ensure that existing laws regulating AI are fully enforced.
They're also said they were excited by the innovative possibilities of AI. Young and Rounds both highlighted the impact that artificial intelligence could have in curing illnesses like cancer and Alzheimer's, and said Congress needs to invest in the innovative technology to avoid medical costs to taxpayers down the line.
""Imagine a world in which we cure cancer, Alzheimer's and other crippling diseases in just a few years' time,"" Young said. ""Imagine a world in which government can be far more efficient, in which we actually figure out how to dramatically cut the healthcare cost curve down.""
The senators also say it's important for Congress to consider growing concerns about the impact AI could have on the workforce, including the possibility that workers could be displaced from their jobs by artificial intelligence. They encourage the lawmakers to engage stakeholders across unions and civil society to ensure that workers are trained and retrained to work with AI rather than be displaced by it.
There has not yet been a major piece of legislation regulating AI to pass Congress. While early efforts have seen some evidence of bipartisanship, it's not yet clear what sort of support large scale regulatory efforts would ultimately receive.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-05-14,'It's a real thing': Drivers and passengers report motion sickness in EVs,Some EVs have an eco mode that's set up to make the throttle less sensitive.,"An oft-touted advantage of owning an electric vehicle is one-pedal driving, when drivers can slow down a vehicle simply by lifting off the throttle.
But as more Americans swap their gas-powered cars and trucks for an EV, some are also realizing there are drawbacks to the one-pedal lifestyle.
""It can cause some people to get sick,"" John Voelcker, a former editor of Green Car Reports and a contributing editor at Car and Driver, told ABC News. ""Strong regenerative braking, which recaptures max energy, can cause motion sickness. There is a learning curve to lifting off the accelerator in an EV ... you have to modulate it.""
Voelcker said he has felt queasy at least twice while riding in the back seat of a Tesla.
""The drivers didn't know how to modulate Tesla's strong regen braking,"" he recalled. ""I was thrown around a little bit.""
Ed Kim, president and chief analyst of AutoPacific, said Teslas are the ""worst offenders"" because they can be ""very jerky and really abrupt.""
""Most automakers have tuned the throttles to be jumpy in EVs to emphasize the power, but the side effect is that they can lurch and make some occupants car sick. You have to be so careful on how to apply the throttle ... if not, it can lead to an abrupt seesaw motion for passengers,"" Kim told ABC News.

Kim said his wife has gotten nauseous in a Tesla Model Y and he's heard of similar experiences from other motorists. The extremely quick acceleration of EVs can be disorienting to Americans who learned how to drive with an gasoline engine.
""EVs have so much torque -- you tap the throttle and the thing just takes off. The abruptness of power delivery can be unsettling to some people. If you set really high regenerative braking, the car lurches forward and rocks and back forth a lot,"" he said.
Dr. D.J. Verret, an ear, nose and throat doctor in Texas, said motion sickness in EVs ""is a real thing.""
Verret pointed out that the lack of sound in an EV can also worsen the experience for passengers, especially those already prone to motion sickness.
""The brain sets up a model for what it expects in certain situations,"" he told ABC News. ""In combustion cars, you hear the engine revving and know someone is stepping on the accelerator. The car moves forward. In an EV, the auditory and visual inputs don't fit the model that you are actually moving.""
Passengers are more susceptible to dizziness and nausea in an EV than drivers, especially when they're in the back seat.
""If you're the driver, your head moves when you turn the wheel to the left,"" he said. ""Our brain is responding to what it's expecting to happen. If you're a passenger, you can't see those motions. If you have a certain lateral acceleration -- like turning a corner fast -- that will increase your potential for dizziness and motion sickness.""
Monica Jones, an associate research scientist at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, has been studying motion sickness for years. It's a topic that's gathering ""a lot of interest,"" she told ABC News, adding that researchers are still not clear on why some people are more sensitive to motion sickness.
She recently completed a study with an automaker that looked at longitudinal jerk, ""which is what happens with regen braking,"" she said.
Jones and her team modulated the jerk in an automated vehicle while maintaining its peak acceleration. Participants were ""very sensitive to the jerk,"" she said.
""Motion sickness ratings increased on average throughout the duration of the trial and significant interactions were observed between levels of longitudinal jerk and time,"" she said. ""The highest rate of accumulation or earliest onset of motion sickness was observed for the jerk condition with the highest magnitude.""

Jones said this research could help automakers ameliorate motion sickness in EVs as they continue to refine the technology with newer models.
""One-pedal driving is a very different experience than combustion engines,"" she said. ""Even if you learn how to effectively do one-pedal driving, uncertainty in the environment -- like traffic -- can still cause motion sickness.""
There are EVs available now that ride similarly to an internal combustion engine vehicle, a bonus for those looking to avoid a Tesla-like ride. Hyundai's new Ioniq 5 N, a chic hatch that makes 641 horsepower, comes with fake gearing and artificial engine noises, delivering a gas-powered experience on and off the track.
Matt Farah, host of the popular ""The Smoking Tire"" podcast and editor-at-large for Road & Track, said he was so blown away by the Ioniq 5 N that his perspective on EVs has changed.
""We now know it's possible to make an EV fun,"" he told ABC News. ""The synthetic gearbox and synthetic noises successfully mimic what we like about gasoline sports cars.""
The 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N has artificial engine noises and gearing that mimic an internal combustion engine vehicle.
Hyundai
Farah said he, too, has been queasy in an EV before, especially when going really fast or doing full throttle launches.
""If I do two or three launches in a row in an EV, I don't feel great after,"" he said. ""The way an EV motor delivers power -- and the absence of sound -- are what make you feel dizzy going fast in one.""
Hyundai's decision to include the fake gearing and noises (N e-shift and N active sound+) ""were not created to alleviate queasiness or motion sickness, although it is possible that these features might indirectly help reduce some of those effects for electric vehicle drivers,"" a company spokesperson told ABC News.
Either way, Farah, who test drove the Ioniq 5 N in California last month, said more automakers should follow Hyundai's example.
""You have more control over what the car is doing with the gears. You want to control what the car is doing -- that is the point of driving,"" he said. ""You realize the sound is fake, but after a few minutes of driving, it's giving what you need and it works.""
The Cadillac Lyriq, a sleek electric sport utility vehicle that went into production last year, may not have fake engine noises but its tuning and drive quality has won over motorists who are anti one-pedal driving.
""It's the closest approximation to an ICE car that I have seen in a while,"" Voelcker said.
Kevin Cansiani, an engineer who worked on the Cadillac Lyriq, said the electric SUV delivers seamless torque when the throttle is pressed.
Cadillac
The Lyriq does not lurch forward unexpectedly like some of the other electric SUVs, Kim pointed out.
""The acceleration is more gentle,"" he said. ""The passenger experience is more like a traditional gas car -- no matter who drives it.""
MORE: Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe says he's changing mindsets of what's 'possible in an electric vehicle'
Kevin Cansiani, a senior engineer at Cadillac, told ABC News the Lyriq drives even better than an ICE car.
""My gripe with ICE transmissions are those shifts and jerks you always get,"" he said. ""With the Lyriq, there's just this feeling of seamless torque. The goal of the engineers was to make the Lyriq have a premium drive quality.""
Cansiani 's team tuned the Lyriq so that passengers and drivers alike would not be affected by the SUV's throttle response.
""We came up with a common set of throttle mapping and had specific drive scorecards. We took objective measurements on jerk -- that sting you feel,"" he said.
The Lyriq offers three regen modes -- off, normal or high. Cansiani said the majority of Lyriq customers choose the normal mode for the ""instant feel of negative torque.""
And driving with the regen off won't impact range, Cansiani noted.
""You're not losing a lot of range,"" he said. ""We have blended braking on the Lyriq. The brake pedal, when pressed, will command as much regen as possible. When maxed out, only then will it transition to friction braking.""
For electric car rookies, there are ways to minimize the shock when driving some EVs on the market.
""People who are newer to EVs are not accustomed to how powerful and torquey these things can be,"" Kim noted, adding that it's relatively easy to get comfortable with the tech.
He recommended that drivers set up eco mode in their EVs to make the throttle less sensitive. ""It will give you a more relaxed driving style,"" he said.
His other suggestion was that engineers adjust the throttle mapping in an electric vehicle so it more closely mimics how a gasoline-powered car moves and operates.
Voelcker said regen braking is different on every EV and some vehicles may be better than others for those with a lead foot. He personally is a fan of the driving technique: ""I don't touch the brakes. The car does the braking for you.""
Worst case scenario for those who are having trouble with the EV's stop-start manner? Shut off the regen entirely, Voelcker said.
""It's about muscle control in the foot,"" he explained. ""People who drive gas cars, they don't glide. They accelerate to the stop sign then slam on the brakes.""
He added, ""A lot of motion sickness, honestly, is because of the driver.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-05-14,Experts say more needs to be done to help protect children from online predators,Protecting children and teens from online dangers is no easy feat.,"Protecting children and teens from online dangers is no easy feat. It's an ever-changing landscape and in many ways, it's easier than ever for predators to target children online.
In 2023, reports of child online exploitation made to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) Cyber Tip Line rose by more than 12%, surpassing 36.2 million reports.
""Child predators used to be the person who was going around driving in a creepy van, going by schools offering candy to kids,"" New Jersey State Police Lt. Paul Sciortino told ABC News. ""The internet has become that van.""
Sciortino works on the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force and investigates cyber tips that come from NCMEC. He told ABC News that the dangers that lurk online can often be overlooked by kids and parents.
Titania Jordan, the Chief Parent Officer at Bark, a technology company that aims to help parents and educators keep children safe online by offering advanced monitoring services through an app and a phone, said there are hundreds of thousands of predators.
Experts say more needs to be done to help protect children from online predators.

""The estimated half a million predators that are known to be online at any time know the internet is a vast playground for children that are online [an] upwards [of] eight hours a day, most of them unmonitored, unfiltered, unrestricted,"" Jordan told ABC News in an interview.
Bark says they use artificial intelligence to analyze the content and context of children's digital signals, whether it's text, social media, email or browsing.
""You're giving [children] access to the entire world, and you're giving the entire world access to them,"" continued Jordan, who spoke about how Bark's app allows parents to receive alerts if their children view something potentially harmful.
""And currently, the laws in place -- at least the United States -- are not holding social media are big tech accountable. They are not liable for what's happening to children on their platform,"" she added.
In January, the CEOs of five major social media companies -- TikTok, Meta, X, Snapchat and Discord -- faced the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee to speak to politicians called a failure to protect kids from sexual exploitation online.
""This disturbing growth in child sexual exploitation is driven by one thing: changes in technology. … Smartphones are in the pockets of seemingly every man, woman and teenager on the planet,"" U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin said in his opening statement during the hearing.
""These apps have changed the way we live, work and play. But, as investigations have detailed, social media and messaging apps have also given predators powerful new tools to sexually exploit children.""
During the hearing, parents sat in the room holding photos of their children who had fallen victim to predators and scammers on those very platforms, many no longer alive.
""I'm sorry for everything you have all been through,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told families in the room. ""No one should go through the things that your families have suffered, and this is why we invest so much, and we are going to continue doing industry-wide efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer.""
Platforms like Meta and Snapchat have introduced new tools they say will help protect teens from unwanted contact and their parents monitor their online activities.

""Child exploitation is a horrific crime,"" a Meta spokesperson said in a written statement to ABC News. ""We've spent years supporting law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting the criminals behind it and have developed over 50 tools, features and resources to protect teens, including to help prevent unwanted contact.
""Our goal is to make it as hard as possible for young people to be contacted by people they don't know, which is why we have extra safeguards for teens to protect against unwanted contact, offer easy blocking tools, and send in-app warnings if someone they don't know tries to contact them,"" said a Snapchat spokesperson.
Experts like Jordan say that while these family parental controls ""sound great"" they don’t give parents or caregivers ""enough of the critical insight that you need to keep your child safe."" She argues that too often children are left responsible for making decisions about their online safety.
""We limit driving age, alcohol and tobacco use, et cetera, but when it comes to the internet, social media gaming, screen time, even, we're leaving it up to the children without giving parents full access and ability to help them become responsible digital natives.""

2024-05-14,OpenAI announces new version of AI language model that fuels ChatGPT,The model eliminates lag in response time and allows for user interruption.,"OpenAI announced a desktop version of its conversation bot ChatGPT on Monday as well as the latest iteration of the AI language model that fuels the chatbot.
The fresh model offers improved speed and interactive capability when compared with the company's previous model GPT-4, OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati said at an event livestreamed by the company.
Known as GPT-4o, the latest version eliminates lag time in the response from ChatGPT and allows users to interrupt the conversation bot with a new query that in turn elicits a modified response, Murati said. The improved capacity, Murati added, functions in response to text, audio and visual prompts.
""We're looking at the future of our interaction between ourselves and the machines, and we think that GPT-4o is really shifting that paradigm,"" Murati said. ""This is the first time we're making a huge step forward when it comes to the ease of use.""
An OpenAI researcher performed a live demonstration in which the new product identified the pace of his breathing and offered him advice on how to relax, and another in which the product provided immediate translation allowing for a conversation between someone speaking Italian and another speaking English.

In a separate demo, the product viewed a researcher's attempt at solving a math equation through his phone camera and provided real-time guidance.
GPT-4o will be released over the coming weeks, Murati said, adding that the company will make the product available gradually in an effort to prevent abuse.
""Our team has been hard at work building in mitigation against misuse,"" Murati said. ""We continue to work with stakeholders.""
OpenAI has sought to release fresh products and upgrades since the November 2022 release of ChatGPT, which reached 100 million app users within two months. That performance set a record for the fastest-growing app user base.
In March 2023, Open-AI released GPT-4, the latest version of its AI language model. Days after the release of GPT-4, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told ABC News that the product scored in the 90th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam. It also scored a near-perfect score on the SAT Math test, and it can proficiently write computer code in most programming languages.
GPT-4 could be ""the greatest technology humanity has yet developed"" to drastically improve our lives,"" Altman told ABC News at the time.
The announcement on Monday arrives three months after OpenAI unveiled its video-generation tool Sora.
Sora composes videos, lasting up to one-minute long, based on user prompts, just as ChatGPT responds to input with written responses and Dall-E offers up images. The video-generator is in use by a group of product testers but is not available to the public, OpenAI said in a statement in February.

The risks posed by AI-generated content have stoked wide concern in recent months.
Fake, sexually explicit AI-generated images of pop star Taylor Swift went viral on social media in late January, garnering millions of views. A fake image of pop singer Katy Perry at the Met Gala circulated widely online last week, even fooling Perry's mother
OpenAI posted a statement online in February outlining measures taken by the company to prevent abuse of Sora.
""We'll be taking several important safety steps ahead of making Sora available in OpenAI's products,"" the company website says. ""We are working with red teamers  --  domain experts in areas like misinformation, hateful content, and bias  -- who will be adversarially testing the model.""
In response to growing scrutiny over AI-produced content, tech platforms have taken steps to regulate such posts ahead of the November election.

Meta announced in February that it would begin labeling images created by OpenAI, Midjourney and other artificial intelligence products. Social media site TikTok said in an online statement last week that it would also start labeling such images.
The series of major product releases in recent years has coincided with leadership turmoil at OpenAI.
Altman abruptly stepped down in November 2023 from his role as CEO of OpenAI. After an employee revolt and a public apology from one of the company's board members, Altman was rehired for the position just four days later.
The decision included a condition for OpenAI to reconfigure its board of directors. Altman's return appeared to involve input from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, whose company made a $10 billion investment in OpenAI last year.
At the end of the event on Monday, Murati hinted at a forthcoming product announcement.
""We also care a lot about the next frontier,"" Murati said. ""Soon we'll be updating you on our progress toward the next big thing.""

2024-05-10,"How eating ultra-processed foods could lead to increased risk of death, study shows",A new study out of Harvard investigated dietary patterns of healthcare professionals for 30 years to correlate highly processed foods with increased risk of death.,"Whole foods in their natural state -- such as fresh fruit and vegetables, grains and lean proteins -- are up against rapidly growing options for ready-to-eat, ultra-processed packaged bites that underdeliver on flavor and nutrition after being refined from what was once a nutrient-dense ingredient into an amalgamation of artificial laden products.
A new 30-year correlation study published Wednesday in the British Medical Journal found that diets high in ultra-processed foods -- such as ready-to-eat meats and artificially sweetened beverages -- are associated with slightly increased risk of death.

Ultra-processed commercial, packaged foods that are made mostly of industrial-generated colors and additives make up the majority of the average American daily intake in 2018 and are now linked to a modest increase in death.

Researchers from Harvard University's TH Chan School of Public Health investigated dietary logs of more than 100,000 U.S.-based health professionals, and categorized these logs into four groups: unprocessed, minimally processed, processed and ultra-processed foods.
The participants had no history of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes at the start of the study and self-reported updates on lifestyle habits and health via questionnaires every two years.
The study's lead author, Dr. Mingyang Song, an associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard’s School of Public Health, cautions that not all processed foods are created equally. For example, ultra-processed whole grains don't pose the same risks as processed meats and sugary foods or drinks.
The ultra-processed group, especially those consumers who consistently reported intake of ready-to-eat meat, poultry, and seafood, had a 4% increase in risk of death at the 30-year follow-up.

Sugar sweetened and artificially sweetened beverages, dairy-based desserts, and breakfast foods, were other ultra-processed products associated with an increase in reported deaths at follow-up.
The study also looked more closely at organ-system specific causes of death, finding that consumption of ultra-processed foods was associated with with an 8% increase in a risk of death from brain disease such as dementia.
""Sauces, spreads and condiments” as well as “sweet snacks and desserts"" made up the majority of the ultra-processed foods in this study, but neither of the diets were directly associated with increased risk of death.
The study defined ""ultra processed"" foods based on a nutritional database from 2014, so food products referenced in this specific study may have changed over time. Reformulations could limit how this data applies to food products in 2024.
Additionally, when considering the data from this study, any recipe that included a single ultra-processed ingredient was classified into that larger category grouping, which could overgeneralize a participant's diet pattern.
The study also did not account for variable socioeconomic backgrounds, which is a known driver of America consumer food purchasing decisions.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-05-09,TikTok rolls out feature to label AI content,"""GMA"" looks at the new feature to label AI-created content in an effort to help battle misinformation.","Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

""Our users and our creators are so excited about AI and what it can do for their creativity and their ability to connect with audiences."" Adam Presser, TikTok's Head of Operations & Trust and Safety told ABC News in an exclusive interview. ""And at the same time, we want to make sure that people have that ability to understand what fact is and what is fiction.""

The social media giant says they are becoming the first video-sharing platform to implement Content Credentials technology -- an open technical standard providing publishers, creators, and consumers the ability to trace the origin of different types of media.
""This is like a nutrition label for content. It tells you what happened in the image, where it was taken, who made it, and the edits that were made along the way,"" explained Adobe's Chief Trust officer Dana Rao during an interview with ABC News earlier this year.

And Content Credentials (digital nutrition labels) are becoming more widely used as a standard to certify digital content.
Earlier this year, OpenAI announced that they would be adding this technology to all images created and edited by DALL.E 3, their latest image model. OpenAI also said it plans to integrate Content Credentials for its video-generational Model, Sora, once it is launched more broadly.

Other products with generative AI capabilities like Adobe Firefly, Photoshop, Express and Microsoft Copilot are among others who are already using the technology to embed metadata into visual content created using their platforms.
""Parts of the picture are falling into place,"" remarked Sam Gregory, executive director of Witness and expert on deepfakes. ""It's essential that specific companies make it as easy as possible to know when content was created with their tools by providing tool-specific classifiers.""
TikTok increases transparency on AI.
Adobe/TikTok
TikTok said the rollout of this new label starts today and will apply to all users globally in the coming weeks. Over the coming months, TikTok will also start attaching Content Credentials to content, which will remain on the content when downloaded allowing other platforms to read the metadata.
With the United States presidential election around the corner and elections stacked across the world, demands to detect AI-generated content online have been growing more intense.
""Neither is a silver bullet, not now or when they are fully utilized and provided - they are a form of harm reduction that makes it easier to discern when and how AI was used,"" explained Gregory. ""Malicious and deceptive creators and distributors will still find a way around them, but most of us will be happy to use them if they don't compromise our privacy or our ability to create.""
Rao believes that we will move toward an online world where content that carries these digital nutrition labels might be more trustworthy or more valuable than those that do not.
""The real value is going to be in authenticity,"" emphasized Rao. ""The creators want to have an authentic communication with their viewers, and so this content credential allows creators to establish the level of authenticity that they want with their audience.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

2024-05-09,What to know about the new AI data center in Wisconsin,"The $3 billion investment by Microsoft is expected to add 2,000 permanent jobs.","President Joe Biden is set to announce on Wednesday a $3 billion investment by tech giant Microsoft to build an artificial intelligence data center in southeast Wisconsin.
The sprawling facility will be located on the same plot of land where, in 2018, former President Donald Trump announced a multi-billion dollar investment by Taiwanese company Foxconn that largely failed to materialize.
The project sits at the convergence of several key Biden administration goals: upgrading U.S. infrastructure, rejuvenating domestic manufacturing and stewarding the responsible development of AI.
MORE: Where is Apple headed after latest product event? Experts weigh in.
Here’s what to know about the economic impact of the project, the significance of the location and why Microsoft is building a data center in the first place.
What’s the expected economic impact of the data center?
The data center in the midsize city of Racine, Wisconsin, is expected to create 2,300 construction jobs and an additional 2,000 permanent jobs at the facility, the White House said in a press release on Wednesday.
The burst of employment will coincide with a venture undertaken by Microsoft to open a so-called ""Datacenter Academy,"" which will train roughly 1,000 people for data center and other technology roles by 2030, the White House said.
Microsoft will also open an innovation lab in the region, which will aim to educate about 1,000 business leaders on how to adopt AI for their enterprises, the White House added.
In a statement, Microsoft President Brad Smith said the data center would help restore the manufacturing sector in Wisconsin. In the 1960s and 70s, the state lost thousands of manufacturing jobs when companies relocated plants overseas.
""Wisconsin has a rich and storied legacy of innovation and ingenuity in manufacturing,"" Smith said. ""We will use the power of AI to help advance the next generation of manufacturing companies, skills and jobs in Wisconsin and across the country.""
The datacenter makes up a portion of the $6.9 billion invested in infrastructure, clean energy and semiconductor projects in Wisconsin since Biden took office, the White House said, part of an administration initiative devoted to domestic industry called ""Invest in America.""
In all, roughly $540 billion have been invested nationwide as part of the Biden administration’s initiative, according to the White House.
Server racks are lined up in a data center server room.

What’s the significance of the location of the project?
The site of the Biden announcement on Wednesday marks the same location where Trump touted a different corporate investment six years ago.
Back then, Trump boasted of a $10 billion investment by electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which he said would create about 13,000 manufacturing jobs.
Despite razing nearby homes and attracting about $3 billion in state tax incentives, Foxconn has largely failed to deliver on its lofty goals. In 2022, the company said it employed more than 1,000 workers in the state, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.
The Biden administration has characterized the AI data center as an effort to make up for the challenges endured by the local area under Trump. It will ""showcase a community at the heart of his commitment to invest in places that have been historically overlooked or failed by the last administration’s policies,"" the administration said.
Why open a data center in the first place?
The computing power required to train and deploy artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT has triggered a spike in demand for data centers.
The complexes, which typically span 100,000 square feet, provide the brick-and-mortar infrastructure underlying the explosion of the AI sector.

In 2022, roughly 2,700 data centers in the U.S. accounted for over 4% of the nation's electricity use, according to an International Energy Agency report released in January. By 2026, that share of electricity use is expected to reach 6%.
The proportion of U.S. electricity use for data centers is expected to continue to climb in the ensuing years, the report said, citing in part anticipated broader adoption of AI.
By 2026, the AI industry alone is expected to consume at least 10 times its energy demand from just three years prior, the IEA report found.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-05-08,Microsoft and LinkedIn talk AI in the workplace,"Microsoft's Satya Nadella and LinkedIn's Ryan Roslansky speak exclusively to ""GMA"" about what artificial intelligence means for your job and how it's impacting the way we work now.","Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

2024-05-08,Where is Apple headed after latest product event? Experts weigh in.,"The tech giant relies on new models of old products, analysts said.","Apple unveiled new models of its iPad at an event on Tuesday, promising revamped devices at affordable prices.
""This is the biggest day for iPad since its introduction,"" CEO Tim Cook declared.
The announcement exemplified the current strategy at Apple: Rely on new models of its signature items, rather than transition to the next big product, analysts told ABC News.
While the world's second-largest company, in terms of market capitalization, risks dependence on longstanding products in a competitive sector, analysts say the approach allows Apple to capitalize upon its loyal customer base and popular devices while it develops new products like Apple Vision Pro, the company's mixed reality headset.

However, with a starting cost of $3,499 and a higher-powered version at around $4,000, Apple Vision Pro remains far from a price point that would make it affordable for a wide audience, says Ben Bajarin, an analyst at research firm Creative Strategies. Further, Apple has remained largely quiet in the industry-wide race toward artificial intelligence technologies and products.
MORE: Starbucks sales are slumping. Is it a bellwether for the economy?
""We still don't know what's next,"" Bajarin said. ""That's what's hard for everybody,"" though he added, ""There's still no company on the planet that has the level of consumer hardware scale that they do.""
Apple did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.
In its latest earnings report, Apple last week revealed a sales slump for some of its mainstay products. Smartphone sales dropped 10% over the three months ending in March, when compared with the same period a year earlier. Even more, iPad sales fell 17% over that period, the earnings report said.
In all, Apple sales fell 4% over the three-month period ending in March, when compared with the same stretch last year.
Speaking on a conference call last week, Cook attributed the decline in sales to a difficult comparison with the quarter one year earlier, when a loosening of COVID-related supply blockages triggered a sales boom. In the absence of that one-time surge, sales would have grown to start 2024, Cook said.
The earnings report set the stage for Apple's event on Tuesday, in which the company rolled out fresh models of its iPad in an effort to bolster sales.
Apple showcased a redesigned 11-inch iPad Air and a newly released 13-inch iPad Air, each of which is equipped with the M2 Chip. The 11-inch iPad Air cost starts at $599, while the 13-inch model goes for $799.
The company also released fresh models of its premium iPad Pro, describing it in an online statement as ""the thinnest Apple product ever."" The 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $999, while the 13-inch iPad Pro begins at $1,299.
Customers can order the new products online now and find them in-store next week, the company said.

Many analysts are looking ahead to the Worldwide Developers Conference next month, when Apple is expected to make a ""major AI announcement,"" Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush, said in a note to investors that was shared with ABC News.
The company may reveal plans to incorporate AI into its next round of iPhone models, potentially supercharging sales of the product, Ives said.
The combination of potential AI updates, coupled with the new iPad models, could amount to a ""broader Apple hardware-driven upgrade cycle over the coming year,"" Ives further noted.
""We believe the seeds for an Apple growth turnaround are being planted in the field by Cook & Co.,"" Ives added.
Still, the strategy of improving pre-existing products rather than introducing new ones leaves Apple's long-term vision somewhat unclear, Bajarin said, while acknowledging that Apple Vision Pro – which became available for purchase in February in the U.S. only – remains in the early development stages. He also acknowledged that the buzzy product's steep price will eventually come down.

""We've gotten glimpses of what's next but everybody realizes it's not around the corner,"" Bajarin said. ""It'll take many years to flesh that out.""
In the meantime, Bajarin said, Apple will likely draw upon its massive customer base and potential AI-driven product upgrades to stabilize sales.
""I'm not concerned at all,"" Bajarin said. ""It's not like they're losing customers to someone else. People are holding onto their stuff for longer because it's good enough.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

""couldn't make it to the MET, had to work,"" wrote Perry in the caption.
ABC News contacted the creator of the doctored images who said he used a combination of tools to get the hyper-realistic quality. The Brazilian Katy Perry superfan, who goes by Sali, told ABC News he did use an AI image-generator to create the image but then used photoshop and a combination of real images to get her face to look as real as possible.
“I use AI to facilitate the editing process, adding texture to the skin and striving for the most realistic outcome possible. I also incorporate real images of people, replacing their faces with Katy Perry’s. Katy’s face is finalized using editing software to ensure a seamless integration,” he told ABC news via Instagram.
The creator whose page is full of Katy Perry creations also elaborated on his process.
“My work involves AI, but most of the time, it's just to touch up details and make things a bit more realistic. AI isn't as advanced as people think. It struggles. It's not like you can just write a prompt and it generates an image of Katy Perry, it's not like that. So, it's manual work, focusing on her body and face. This involves bringing in tattoos, body details, proportions. It's not easy,” he added on Instagram.
Several AI-generated photos of entertainers who did not attend the MET, like Rihanna and Lady Gaga, made the rounds on social media as well.

2024-05-04,"AI gadgets are here, but are they any good?","Artificial intelligence is showing up in more gadgets, to mixed reviews.","If 2023 was the year of AI software, 2024 is shaping up to be the year of AI hardware.
Over the past few months, companies like Google, Samsung, Meta and Microsoft have shown off smartphones and laptops – even glasses – all of which claim to heavily integrate generative artificial intelligence. But the moment has also given rise to a new type of device centered around getting users to interact with AI.
At an event in the TWA Hotel in New York City last month, customers took delivery of the very first Rabbit R1s. Bright orange and about the size and shape of a packet of sticky notes, the device has a compact, 2.88-inch screen, a camera in the top right corner, a scroll wheel, and a button on the side to activate voice controls. The idea, according to Rabbit CEO Jesse Lyu, is to reduce the number of steps it takes to do something you currently do on a smartphone.
Rabbit CEO Jesse Lyu answers questions from reporters at the TWA Hotel, April 23, 2024, in New York.
Michael Dobuski/ABC News
“Our mission is to create the simplest computer – something so intuitive that you don’t need to learn how to use it,” Lyu said at the company’s Consumer Electronics Show keynote in January.
Instead of sifting through pages of apps and notifications, all while trying not to get distracted by Instagram, Rabbit says users can simply speak a command to the R1. Then, using an artificial intelligence technology they call a 'Large Action Model,' the device will fulfill that demand.
At least, that’s the idea.
Rabbit’s early adopters
Daniel Ko is a fractional CFO for AI startups. He says his work doesn’t involve Rabbit at the moment – he’s just a customer for now – but he sees a lot of potential in the R1.
“Personally, for me, I bought it because it looked super cool and, in a way, it's the first generation product of something that could be, you know, like the next iPhone maybe,” Ko told ABC Audio.
“I think in this moment I’m just curious,” said Danny Cole, an artist based in New York City who also has an R1. He says he likes the idea of a device that moves people away from smartphones.

“I think it’s tough for us to predict if phones are the answer to our needs in ten years from now, twenty years from now,” said Cole, adding: “they’re probably not!”
Jonah Cohn is a college student in Chicago. He told ABC Audio that he came to New York just so he could pick up his R1 in person.
“I would definitely consider myself a serial early adopter,” said Cohn, who also owns a Vision Pro, Apple’s mixed reality headset that went on sale earlier this year. “I’m really one who likes to try things in the first generation so I can get a grasp on what’s going to be taking over the rest of our world.”
College student Jonah Cohn holds his Humane AI Pin in the palm of his hand on April 29, 2024.

But he also said that early adoption is risky – especially when it involves artificial intelligence, which has faced criticism for being unreliable and inaccurate.
“I was scared that I was going to get this thing and it’s not gonna do what it says. And I still haven’t figured that out yet, because you know, even though I just got it I’ve only had it for like five minutes, you know?” Cohn said.
The Humane AI Pin
Rabbit isn’t the only tech company staking a claim in the AI gadget space. Humane, a company founded by several former Apple employees, recently started selling the AI Pin, a $699 wearable device 1 3/4 inches square and 1/3 inch thick that attaches to a person’s clothing, like a lapel pin.
“The AI Pin is a totally new kind of computer,” Bethany Bongiorno, CEO of Humane, told ABC Audio. She said despite the price tag – and the monthly $24 phone plan – the Pin is not meant to be a smartphone replacement.
“When you got a smartphone, it didn’t replace your laptop. But it created a very different relationship with your laptop,” Bongiorno said. “It was much more focused – you went to your laptop for certain things that it was very great at. You went to your smartphone for things that it was really great at. And how we see it is the Pin does allow you to have a more focused relationship with your phone.”
MORE: Dispute over threat of extinction posed by artificial intelligence looms over surging industry
According to Humane, a phone is for things like watching videos and scrolling social media. The AI Pin, meanwhile, is intended to handle tasks like sending messages, setting reminders, and looking things up. The Pin’s answers, like the Rabbit, are read aloud by an automated voice. Those answers are generated by a combination of Large Language Models – that is, artificial intelligence technology that can understand and generate human language – from companies like OpenAI and Google. Bongiorno said it’s all in an effort to keep users from getting sucked into their phones.
“I prefer my pin in more moments throughout the day because I choose to want to remain present,” she said. “I personally want to be able to live my life out in the world with my family with my friends, and I want to try to use my phone less.”
However, reviews of the AI Pin have so far been overwhelmingly negative.
The Pin gets panned
Tech reviewer Marques Brownlee, who goes by “MKBHD” on YouTube, titled his review of Humane’s device “The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed... For Now.” A review from tech publication The Verge notes “the AI Pin is not worth the money.”
Engadget Deputy Reviews Editor Cherlynn Low told ABC Audio the device “doesn’t solve any real problem,” and “doesn’t know how to be good.”
“There was this big backlash back when the Humane AI Pin reviews came out where a lot of the reviews were negative, including mine,” said Wired Reviews Editor Julian Chokkattu.
He said his complaints with the Pin covered everything from its limited features to its unreliable AI-generated answers. Several reviewers said the AI Pin took too long to respond to questions, which means they often reverted to their smartphones for answers. Others encountered overheating issues that made the AI Pin uncomfortable to wear.
Humane responded that many of these problems are being addressed in software updates, which will “enable [the] Ai Pin to become smarter and more powerful over time.” The company added that they will continue to make improvements.
In a statement, the company told ABC News that the AI Pin represents “just the first page of the first chapter of an all-new product category.”

Chokkattu, however, said buyers should hold off on purchasing devices that are incomplete: “My request would be that they just ship finished products, but we are not in that world anymore unfortunately.” In the meantime, he said, most people already have a device that does everything the AI gadgets try to do.
“I personally think none of these devices that are coming out have offered anything anywhere close to dethroning, like, the smartphone,” said Chokkattu.
AI gadgets in the real world
Not everyone has had a disappointing experience with these early AI gadgets. Jonah Cohn, the Rabbit R1 early adopter from Chicago, also has a Humane AI Pin. He says it has proven useful, such as when he recently stumbled upon a group of people dressed up in costumes in a park.

“I saw a bunch of people cosplaying in Star Wars outfits, and I was like, 'hey, why are people cosplaying in Star Wars outfits in Chicago today? Is there something going on?' And within a couple seconds it was able to tell me there was a convention going on down the street,” Cohn said. “That was pretty cool. I didn't have to whip out my phone, I didn’t have to disengage from whatever social interaction I was in. I just kinda asked it really quick.”
Even so, aside from the technical capabilities of the device, Cohn said the Pin has presented some social challenges, like the first time he wore it to the grocery store.
“I kinda got embarrassed when I got to the checkout counter, and I quickly, like, took it off my shirt,” he said. “Because like, I know it’s not recording, but the guy at the checkout counter, who I kinda know, doesn’t know that. And I don’t want to really put him through that awkward situation of, ‘is this guy recording me?’”
About a week after the Rabbit event, Danny Cole tested his new R1 in McCarren Park in Brooklyn, New York. When prompted, the device accurately answered questions like “what’s the weather right now?” and “who was the president in 1955?”
In addition, the R1 was also able to identify some things around it using its camera system, saying things like, “these appear to be pigeons,” and, “this is a Jeep Wrangler.”

But Cole admits the device is far from perfect.
“There was a song that I had in my head, and there were certain lyrics that I remembered really clearly. And I was like ‘oh, I bet I can ask the Rabbit what song this is,’” Cole told ABC Audio. “I asked the Rabbit, and it gave me a different song. And I tried again and again and again and it just wouldn’t get the song right.”
After one week of ownership, Cole said he’s disappointed with his purchase. The R1 is missing features he was expecting to be there, and its reliance on AI for its responses means it can be inaccurate.

“It’s unfortunate to say but, like, point blank, it doesn’t really reliably work yet,” said Cole.
Rabbit told ABC News that “the accuracy and detail of [the R1’s responses] is based solely on” the large language models it uses. Rabbit has also started sending out software updates to address some issues.
But for now, Cole’s smartphone isn’t going anywhere.
“It’s really neat to show people – look at it when it works,” he said of the Rabbit R1. “But it’s not useful until you can rely on it to work.”

2024-05-02,"How kelp farms, an 'environmental powerhouse,' can help mitigate climate change","Underwater forests could be the answer to helping to mitigate the environment from the impacts of climate change, according to experts.","Underwater forests could be the answer to helping to mitigate the environment from the impacts of climate change, experts told ABC News.
Kelp, large brown algae or seaweeds that grow in shallow oceans, is a nutrient-rich species that grows quickly, helping it to absorb carbon dioxide at a higher rate than other ecosystems, including all of the CO2 released from eelgrass, salt marshes and mangroves combined, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The efficiency at which kelp is able to pluck the greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere is one of the many reasons why it is increasingly being identified as a potential solution to climate change, the experts said. In addition, the growth requires no fertilizer or fresh water, making it nearly 100% sustainable.
Long Island kelp farmer Sue Wicks holds a line of kelp in the Moriches Bay.
ABC News
Often farmed next to oysters and mussels, kelp can be used for a multitude of purposes, including both food and cosmetic applications. There are likely uses of kelp that haven't even been discovered yet, Sue Wicks, kelp farmer and oyster farmer on Long Island, New York, told ABC News.
""Kelp is an environmental powerhouse,"" Wicks said.

Wicks, a former WNBA player, is now continuing a 400-year tradition of generations of family working on the water, she said. Her ancestors arrived in the region in the 1600s, and her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather -- tracing all the way back -- were baymen.
But in the 1980s, brown tides along the Long Island coast decimated the aquaculture industry, Wicks said. Long Island was previously home to the largest bay scallop fishery on the East Coast, but harmful algal blooms beginning in the 1980s and 1990s led to the collapse of the industry.
""Pollutants, septic runoff, lawns, fertilizers -- and that's nitrogen getting in the water, which is an explosive growth accelerant for the algae,"" Wicks said. Once the algal blooms spread, it ""chokes the life out of the water"" and can cause thousands of fish to wash up dead, she added.

ABC News
Anthropogenic, or human-caused, climate change threatens to worsen those algal blooms as well as add other heat-related issues, such as acidification -- a process that is already killing off coral reefs, Christopher Gobler, a researcher at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at Stony Brook University on Long Island, told ABC News.
""More CO2 into the ocean, lowers the pH of the ocean seawater and makes it more acidic,"" Gobler said. ""And that is a danger to a lot of marine life.""
MORE: Installation underway of 15 acres of 3D-printed artificial reefs in coastal North Carolina
The acidification doesn't allow oysters, clams or mussels to form properly because the acidity eats their little shells when they're so vulnerable, Wicks said. Therefore, the region rarely gets naturally propagating native oysters anymore.
Gobler began incorporating seaweed into his labs about a decade before kelp. When researchers put the kelp into water, they observed it taking carbon dioxide and nitrogen out of the water and replacing it with oxygen, Gobler said.

A 1-acre kelp farm in the Moriches Bay can remove as much nitrogen as 20 advanced septic systems, Gobler said.
Kelp farming has been growing in the U.S. in recent years. In 2021, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed legislation to permit kelp cultivation and to restore water quality and marine life habitats.

There are about 35 oyster farms on Long Island, but Wicks is the only farm permitted to grow sugar kelp, a species that Wicks is using as a soil amendment -- a more sustainable form of fertilizer without the dangerous chemicals, she said.

The quest to ensuring a healthy environment will require efforts from all fronts, Wicks said.

2024-05-01,"The US is in a Cold War with China over Taiwan, expert says",Dmitri Alperovitch says another Cold War has started between the U.S. and China over control of Taiwan.,"National security expert Dmitri Alperovitch, a co-founder of CrowdStrike and the company's former chief technology officer, discusses rising tensions between the U.S., China, and Taiwan in his book ""World on the Brink.""
Last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited China to meet with President Xi Jinping and China's foreign minister. During the meeting, President Xi expressed his belief that the two nations should work together as partners rather than rivals.
However, an escalating trade war, differences of opinion regarding Taiwan, and opposing views on the Russia-Ukraine conflict have all contributed to the increasingly tense relationship between the United States and China.
Alperovitch says he feels like the U.S. is in another Cold War with China and they must win the artificial intelligence race, the semiconductor race and the space race.
ABC News had an in-depth conversation with Alperovitch as he dissected the intricate geopolitical challenge the U.S. is facing with China.
ABC NEWS LIVE: Late last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveled to China to meet with President Xi and China's foreign minister. President Xi said the two countries should be partners, not rivals, but a growing trade war, differing opinions on Taiwan and opposing views on the Russia-Ukraine war have only further contributed to the sharp tensions between our two countries.
In his new book, ""World on the Brink: How America Can Beat China in the Race for the 21st Century,"" leading national security expert Dmitri Alperovitch, who is also co-founder of one of the world's largest cybersecurity companies, CrowdStrike, breaks down the geopolitical challenge the U.S. faces with China.
First and foremost? How to deter China from invading Taiwan. And joining us now is Mr. Alperovitch. Dimitri, thank you so much for joining us.
So just last week, China described that they'd like to have a peaceful reunification with Taiwan. In response, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. continues to pursue the One China policy and does not support Taiwan independence. What do you think of that response? Does that sound like the United States will not support, defend Taiwan if China decides to invade?
DIMITRI ALPEROVITCH: No. The One China policy means that we are for the status quo. We're not for forceful reunification or unification with Taiwan or else do not support Taiwan declare independence. This has been our policy for 50-plus years. However, China is the one that is trying to break the status quo. They are the ones that are gearing up for invasion, train their military to execute this plan, similar to what [Russian President] Vladimir Putin did in Ukraine. They're trying to do in Taiwan.
ABC NEWS LIVE: And you warned about Russia's invasion of Ukraine long before many others did. And you quote national security official Rob Joyce in your book who says Russia is a hurricane and China is climate change. What did he mean by that?
ALPEROVITCH: He means that it's a pacing throughout. This is a long-term play for China. Russia is an immediate problem. Certainly the brutal war that they've waged in Ukraine is a major concern for us. But I believe in the next 4 to 8 years, China may go after Taiwan. And the reason why that timeline is that Xi is now in his 70s. He is looking at the end of his term, potentially in 2032, and he wants to do this on his watch, just like Putin wanted to do it on his watch in Ukraine.
ABC NEWS LIVE: And so you, do you feel that this is a matter of when, not if?
ALPEROVITCH: I think for Xi, yes. I think another Chinese leader may push this off to future generations, but he has said specifically he wants to do it in his time frame.
ABC NEWS LIVE: With regard to our economy, our military, the United States certainly seems to be in a better place than China. But what do we need to do in order to really try to deter them from invading Taiwan?
ALPEROVITCH: Well, I believe there are two things here: I believe we're in a Cold War with China. Cold War 2, as I call it, that is remarkably similar to the first Cold War.
And the first thing is, yes, we need to make sure that China does not take Taiwan. Taiwan is really existential to U.S. interests because of its position in the region; whoever controls Taiwan, really controls that Indo-Pacific region. But secondly, we have to win the Cold War, and that is a technological war. We have to win the AI race, the semiconductor race, the space race, all of those things that are playing out right now in the technological realm. We have to make sure we're leading.
ABC NEWS LIVE: Do you think that we're well suited to win those races?
ALPEROVITCH: I think we have all the ingredients for victory. The big question is, do we have the political will?
ABC NEWS LIVE: And what do you say with regard to China's economy? I mean, it's pretty much in shambles at this point because of a real estate bubble. But does that make them more likely to invade Taiwan or less likely?
ALPEROVITCH: In the past, you've certainly had cases where domestic disturbances have led to adventurism overseas, whether it's Mao interfering in Korea, Korean War or Vietnam War, during the Cultural Revolution. So it may very well drive Xi if he thinks that he's not going to catch up with the United States in terms of being the biggest economy, it may drive him to go for this sooner.
ABC NEWS LIVE: I want to ask you about TikTok. That's not something that you discuss in your book, but as a cybersecurity expert, how dangerous do you think the TikTok really is? Obviously, Congress seems to think if it's not sold by its parent company that it should be banned. Do you feel that that's too drastic of a step?
ALPEROVITCH: No, I don't. And the danger here is really not privacy, because, let's face it, Americans have no privacy anymore. All the data is available.
The Chinese can buy it off data brokers the dangerous influence, because you don't know what you are seeing on TikTok and what you're not seeing, what is being filtered by both the algorithms and moderators on that platform. It is controlled by foreign adversary.
And imagine if we had Pravda published in the United States everywhere at the same subscription numbers as The New York Times; would never let that happen during the first Cold War. We should not let it happen during second.
ABC NEWS LIVE: Dmitri Alperovitch, we thank you so much for the discussion. Quite an insightful conversation.
ALPEROVITCH: thank you",,,,,,,,,,,,

Selected excerpts of the report to President Joe Biden were made public after he signed an executive order three months ago on artificial intelligence.
The lack of regulations in existing U.S. biological and chemical security, combined with the increase in using AI, when combined with the increased use of AI tools ""could increase the likelihood of both intentional and unintentional dangerous research outcomes that pose a risk to public health, economic security, or national security,"" according to the DHS report.

""The responsible use of AI holds great promise for advancing science, solving urgent and future challenges and improving our national security, but AI also requires that we be prepared to rapidly mitigate the misuse of AI in the development of chemical and biological threats,"" said Assistant Secretary for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Mary Ellen Callahan.
""This report highlights the emerging nature of AI technologies, their interplay with chemical and biological research and the associated risks, and provides longer-term objectives around how to ensure safe, secure and trustworthy development and use of AI,"" she said.
DHS also said that the diverse approaches of AI developers make it crucial that the U.S. and international partners communicate and harness ""AI's potential for good.""
""The degree to which nation states or groups interested in pursuing these unconventional weapons capabilities will harness such AI tools remains unclear, however, since there are various technical and logistical hurdles that have to be met to develop fully functioning weapons systems that can be used,"" Javed Ali, the former senior counterterrorism coordinator on the National Security Council, told ABC News. ""That said, it is more likely that AI tools will be more helpful on the research and theoretical design end of the spectrum than the actual manufacture and deployment of such weapons, especially with respect to nuclear weapons.""

A separate DHS report produced by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) last week highlighted that some attacks could be carried out of helped by using AI -- including those targeting critical infrastructure.
""It is clear that foreign intelligence services, terrorist groups and criminal organizations have embraced the power of technology and incorporated the use of advanced computing capability into the tactics they use to achieve their illegal objectives,"" John Cohen, the former Acting Undersecretary for Intelligence and Analysis at DHS said. ""Terrorists, criminals and other threat actors can use AI to acquire the instructions on how to develop explosives and other weapons of mass destruction. They can also glean greater insights on potential targets, and on delivery methods to use to achieve the greatest possible disruptive result.""
Last year, the European Parliament approved landmark legislation that aimed to regulate the use of AI and promote ""trustworthy"" uses.

The board, according to the agency, will help DHS stay ahead of evolving threats posed by hostile nation-state actors and reinforce national security by helping to deter and prevent those threats.
Cohen, now an ABC News contributor, said the board is a good step, but there is more to be done.

Shark conservation has been so successful that researchers are finding ways to curb human-shark interaction
Shark conservation efforts in the last two decades have been so successful that researchers are testing ways to mitigate human-shark conflict as populations continue to rise.
Sharks are increasingly becoming a nuisance to fishers as they engage in depredation -- or the act of attacking or plundering -- of catch. A device about the size of a roll of quarters that shocks sharks that attempt to bite on fishing lines may be the answer to reducing shark depredation as well as sharks ending up as bycatch.

The conversation surrounding climate change action can often feel too lofty for individuals to have a measurable impact, but on this Arbor Day, change can begin at the root.
Planting trees in honor of Arbor Day is a longstanding American tradition that dates back to 1872, and while climate and landscape factors have changed since the holiday's inception, the motivation remains crucial.

Controversial methods to cool earth by reflecting sunlight gain traction as global temperatures rise
The planet has been experiencing a relentless stretch of record-breaking global temperatures with the rate and impact of climate change accelerating, according to the World Meteorological Organization.
As the impacts of human-amplified climate change intensify and become more severe, relatively untouched ideas are gaining momentum as potential short-term solutions to lower Earth's temperature.
Solar radiation modification, or solar geoengineering, is a concept that covers several different technologies or approaches to essentially reflect sunlight back into space to manipulate the planet's temperature.

As EV demand slows, a new alternative fuel garners attention
While electric vehicles' share of the automotive market is still growing, the rate at which Americans are buying new electric vehicles appears to be slowing.
Some blame the sales decline in part on continued frustrations with charging EVs, including the lack of available charging stations, and the vehicles' short range.
While automakers and the government address those concerns, others have focused on how to make the gas-burning vehicles that are already on the road greener.

Months after storm devastated Shreveport, Louisiana, planting the seeds of change: Reporter's Notebook
Louisiana is a state often defined by its history with hurricanes. These powerful storms are named, in part, so we never forget the bad ones: Katrina, Rita, Laura, Betsy, Audrey… to list a mere few of the named hurricanes that have left a destructive mark on the Pelican State.
The mention of any of these names will bring an emotional reaction to anybody that has lived through one. And just about everybody that has lived in Louisiana for more than a decade has experienced the wrath and aftermath of a hurricane.

Climate change has disproportionately impacted these vulnerable US communities, experts say
Researchers have been warning for years that the world's most vulnerable populations will suffer the most dire consequences of climate change.
But the disproportionate impacts of climate change on the poorest communities – the members of which contribute the least amount of greenhouse gas emissions – are already affecting pockets of the U.S. as extreme weather events are exacerbated by warming global temperatures, events in recent years have shown.

날짜 없음,Miami's Martino shuts down Gillette turf concerns; Messi fit,요약 없음,"Inter Miami CF head coach Gerardo ""Tata"" Martino shut down artificial turf doubts when confirming the availability of Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez for selection vs. the New England Revolution on Saturday at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.
""The players are all available, and those who are healthy will travel. We will see the formation to face the New England Revolution a little later,"" Martino said during a Friday news conference. ""We previously played on artificial turf at Charlotte last year and had no problem."" 
- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)
Messi formed part of the Inter Miami side that took on Charlotte FC on Bank of America Stadium's turf. Messi played the entirety of the game in the 1-0 loss. The Argentine striker had reaffirmed his disposition to play on any field during his introductory news conference last summer.
""The truth is my youth was spent on artificial turf, my whole life was on that pitch,"" Messi said at his 2023 news conference after joining the club. ""Truth is it's been a while since I've played on artificial turf, but I have no problem adapting myself again.""
New signing Matías Rojas will also be available to start, as well as Robert Taylor and  Leo Campana, who recently recovered from injury. Jordi Alba, however, is to remain on the sideline for another week.
""Matias Rojas forms part of the roster and will travel with the team to face New England Revolution. But Jordi Alba will not travel. I said last week that he wouldn't be available against the Revolution, but starting next week we will monitor him game by game,"" Martino said.
""Since the season started, we've been dealing with injury concerns. The last one to fall was  Diego [Gómez]; obviously it's been at different times and the evolution of each player is different, but this week we have the possibility to bring back Robert Taylor and Leo Campana, who will form part of the roster traveling to New England. And next week, we will begin monitoring the situation with Jordi and Federico Redondo.""
The upcoming stretch of games before Copa América kicks off on June 20 is vital for Inter Miami. The head coach emphasized the importance of racking up points before players depart to join various participating national teams.
""Twenty-four points [from this stretch of games before Copa América] would make me happy, but it's difficult to calculate things in that way,"" he said. ""All games are important, and we play away a lot.
""The best thing that happened was recovering well after the elimination against Monterrey. The team managed two league victories, and we have a good amount of points.""
The Herons currently lead the Eastern Conference table with 18 points in 10 games and a 5-2-3 record.",,,,,,,,,,,,

""The two sides had in-depth, substantive, and constructive discussions about areas of difference as well as areas of cooperation as part of responsibly managing competition between the United States and the PRC,"" according to Spokesperson Matthew Miller of the U.S. State Department.

Following up on the Woodside Summit between President Biden and President Xi last November, Blinken and Wang Yi discussed ""next steps on a range of commitments made by the two leaders on advancing cooperation on counternarcotics, military-to-military communication, talks on artificial intelligence risks and safety, and facilitating people-to-people exchanges,"" officials said.
Blinken emphasized that the U.S. will continue to stand up for our interests and values and those of America's allies and partners, including on human rights and economic issues.

2024-04-26,Baltimore high school athletic director used AI to create fake racist audio of principal: Police,"A Baltimore high school athletic director was arrested after he allegedly used artificial intelligence to create a hoax centered on the school's principal, police said.","Police arrested a Baltimore high school athletic director Thursday after they said they discovered he allegedly used artificial intelligence to create a phony audio recording of the school's principal that went viral and cost the school leader his job temporarily and his safety.
Principal Eric Eisworth was removed from his position at Pikesville High School after the school district began investigating the audio clip that was circulated among staff and social media in January where it appeared Eisworth made racist comments against Black and Jewish persons, investigators allege.
The three-month probe, which involved local police and the FBI, concluded that the audio was forged using AI tools by Dazhon Darien, the athletic director at the school, according to Baltimore Chief of Police Robert McCollough.
In this Jan. 30, 2024, file photo, the sign for Pikesville High School is shown in Pikesville, Maryland.

""Detectives alleged Mr. Darien…made the recording to retaliate against the principal who had launched an investigation into the potential mishandling of school funds,"" McCollough told reporters at a news conference Thursday.
MORE: Experts warn of rise in scammers using AI to mimic voices of loved ones in distress
The situation began on Jan. 16, when the recording that appeared to be a conversation between Eisworth and an assistant principal first circulated, according to the charging documents.
In the audio, Eisworth allegedly claimed Black students were unable to ""test their way out of a paper bag"" and made ""disparaging comments"" about Jewish individuals and two teachers, the charging document said.
Investigators said the audio had ""profound repercussions"" for Eisworth and the school community.
""It not only led to Eisworth's temporary removal but also triggered a wave of hate-filled messages on social media and numerous calls to the school,"" the charging document said.
As school officials began investigating the incident, Eisworth maintained that the conversation in the audio never happened and told investigators that Darien, 31, may have been involved because he was good with technology, according to the charging document.
In this Jan. 17, 2024, file photo, a school bus for Baltimore County Public Schools is shown.

Eisworth ordered an investigation into Darien in December over allegations that he misused school funds, the charging document said.

Darien was one of three teachers who first received the audio from a mysterious e-mail, the charging document read. One of the other teachers told investigators she forwarded the message to a Pikesville High student ""who she knew would rapidly spread the message around various social media outlets,"" according to the charging documents.
The unidentified teacher also forwarded the audio to several media outlets and groups including the NAACP, investigators said.
That teacher initially kept information from investigators that indicated that Darien was one of the original recipients of the message, the charging document said.
When Darien was questioned by investigators, he claimed that he did not know who the person was who sent him the audio, according to investigators. However, investigators were able to determine that the email address that sent out the audio was registered to Darien, the charging document said.
The Baltimore Police Department provided the audio to two forensic analysts who specialize in AI and they determined the recording had elements of AI-generated content, according to the charging document.
Detectives allege that Darien used his Large Language Models, such as OpenAI and Bing chat, to create the recording. The charging document claimed that Darien has a paid OpenAI account, which gives users more features than the free version.
Dazhon Darien is shown in this booking photo released by the Baltimore County Police Department.
Baltimore County Police Department
He was arrested at Thurgood Marshall Airport Thursday morning as he was trying to board a flight to Houston and charged with several criminal counts including disrupting a school operation and stalking, police and charging documents said.
Investigators said that Darien tried to declare a gun at the airport and that triggered a security check that revealed the arrest warrant issued last night.
The investigation is ongoing.
Darien was released on a $5,000 unsecured bond Thursday afternoon. Attorney information for the defendant wasn't immediately available.
Baltimore County School Superintendent Myriam Rogers told reporters that the administrative process to discipline Darien has begun which she said could lead to his termination.

She added that the school is also investigating the other teachers who were involved in spreading the audio.

Rogers said that for now, interim leaders would serve out the rest of the school year at Pikesville High School while the investigation continues.
""We will work with principal Eisworth and the Pikesville community concerning next year,"" she said.
""We are grateful we can bring some sense closure to the community and we can now shift our focus to moving forward and providing all parties with a fresh start,"" Rogers added.",,,,,,,,,,,,

2024-04-20,"Data centers fuel AI and crypto but could threaten climate, experts say","Energy usage of data centers is expected to soar in coming years, experts say, threatening the climate.","ABC News is taking a look at solutions for issues related to climate change and the environment with the series, “The Power of Us: People, The Climate, and Our Future.”
Artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency and remote work – all of these buzzy trends depend on processing power delivered by a sprawling worldwide network of data centers.
As demand surges for the power-intensive complexes, which typically span 100,000 square feet, the increased energy usage could jeopardize the fight to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change, experts told ABC News.
""The growth trend is super-fast,"" Fengqi You, an energy engineering professor at Cornell University, told ABC News. ""This is something I'm concerned about.""
In 2022, roughly 2,700 data centers in the U.S. accounted for over 4% of the nation's electricity use, according to an International Energy Agency report released in January. By 2026, that share of electricity use is expected to reach 6%.
MORE: How the UN Plastics Treaty aims to tackle the pollution crisis
The proportion of U.S. electricity use for data centers is expected to continue to climb in the ensuing years, the report said, citing anticipated broader adoption of AI and crypto.
By 2026, the AI industry alone is expected to consume at least ten times its energy demand from just three years prior, the IEA report found.
Nvidia, a California-based firm that sells the majority of computer chips behind the AI boom, exemplifies this growth. Over three months ending in January, the company's revenue surged 265% compared to the same period a year prior, an earnings report showed.
""If Nvidia keeps growing in the way they're hoping they'll grow and keeps selling in the way they're planning to, that's a fairly large increase in energy usage,"" Arman Shehabi, a staff scientist in energy technologies at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, told ABC News.
In response to ABC News' request for comment, a Nvidia spokesperson said the company's products would reduce energy use in data centers, since Nvidia uses accelerated computing enabled by specialized hardware called a graphics processing unit, or GPU.
“Replacing conventional servers with GPU-accelerated systems will reduce, not increase, energy use in datacenters,"" the spokesperson said. ""For example, a single GPU-accelerated server can replace hundreds of conventional servers to accomplish the same workload. And our GPUs enable AI-enhanced systems that will be more energy efficient across all industries, including transportation, manufacturing, logistics, and energy, among others.”
In its fiscal year 2023 annual corporate responsibility report, the company highlighted what they said were AI-driven tools helping to address climate change, including carbon reduction and management.
Cryptocurrency, meanwhile, accounted for about 0.4% of global energy consumption in 2022, which was equivalent to the total energy footprint of the Netherlands that same year, the IEA report found. The primary strain on data centers imposed by crypto is the result of crypto mining, which is the computing process used to complete transactions and generate new coins.

In addition, the shift to remote work caused as much as a 35% spike in demand for data-center usage during the COVID-19 pandemic, Tevfik Kosar, professor of computer science and engineering at the University at Buffalo, told ABC News.
While the increased demand ebbed as many employees returned to work, the persistence of hybrid work arrangements has elevated such data-center demand above pre-pandemic levels, he added.
""That capacity increase didn't really go back to normal,"" Kosar said.
In all, the electric power sector accounted for nearly a quarter of U.S. carbon emissions in 2022, making it the second-largest industry emitter behind transportation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says on its website. More than half of the nation's electricity came from fossil-fuel sources, including coal and natural gas, the EPA adds.
The information technology sector – of which data centers make up a key part – accounts for about 3% of global carbon emissions, which matches the share of worldwide emissions produced by the aviation industry, Kosar said.
""That is not so small,"" he noted.

Shehabi, of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said efforts are underway to improve the sustainability of data centers by connecting them with renewable sources of electricity. As data centers boom in the coming years, they will offer a test case for how to accommodate a spike in electricity usage while addressing the climate impact, Shehabi said.
""How we address that growth will set the stage of how we address the growth of other economic sectors over the coming decades in a way that's sustainable,"" Shehabi added.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-04-20,How pollsters are (and aren't) fighting fraud,How do political pollsters protect against spam and bad-faith actors in their polls?,"Recent headlines about China deploying fake social media accounts to try to mislead voters ahead of the 2024 election caught the eye of one of our readers. “[I] started thinking about how, if you set up enough false accounts, the Chinese or the Russians [...] could conceivably manipulate seemingly legitimate poll results,” Rebecca McPheters wrote in an email to 538. It was an intriguing hypothetical, but we don’t have to imagine the worst-case scenarios to identify threats to polling — there are very real threats already well documented.
As it has become increasingly difficult to get respondents to pick up the phone and take a survey, more and more pollsters have been relying on other methods, such as text-to-web and online opt-in surveys, to gather data. But these approaches come with their own challenges and risks, including the possibility of fraudulent responses from click farms, professional poll-takers or nefarious meddlers. There are lots of safeguards pollsters can use to mitigate these threats, but as fraudsters get more savvy and tools like generative artificial intelligence become increasingly accessible, are they enough to keep polls accurate and secure?
Let’s start with the basics. Small monetary compensation is often offered in exchange for completing a survey. This attracts bad actors that include professional survey takers (who may not be completely honest or accurate in their responses, since they’re just trying to get through them as quickly as possible), and fraudsters automating responses to complete surveys en masse and rack up rewards.
While it doesn’t amount to a lot of money in either case, for individuals in some developing countries, it can be enough to make it worthwhile. InnovateMR and OpinionRoute, two marketing research firms, last year identified individuals who have fraudulently completed surveys for money in Venezuela and Bangladesh and interviewed them, learning they could earn between $200 and $2,500 a month.
“In isolation, it may not sound like a meaningful amount to the average person. But at scale, if they're able to find ways to navigate and break through companies’ defenses, they're able to not just take one survey, but a multitude of surveys — sometimes the same survey over and over and over again — to then scale and aggregate a larger incentive pool for themselves,” said Lisa Wilding-Brown, the CEO of InnovateMR.
Standard methods for securing surveys include simple checks like making sure a respondent's IP address matches their stated location, using “trap” questions to catch automated responses (such as “if you’re paying attention, please respond to this question with answer C”), evaluating how long it takes a respondent to complete a survey (if they finish what should be a 20-minute survey in 5 minutes, that’s a sign something is amiss) and looking for identical wording (or gibberish) in open-ended questions from multiple respondents. With the emergence of generative AI, however, fraudsters may be able to outsmart the tools put in place to keep them at bay, solving problems like trap questions and eliminating giveaways like repeat answers and gibberish. Other, more detailed analyses can also be used to weed out bad-faith responses.
“We will see a lack of knowledge about politics in general: people who say that they're extremely motivated to vote but can't answer questions that somebody who really is truly a likely voter should be able to answer,” said Ken Alper, the president of SurveyUSA. His firm also looks for “people who have inconsistent opinions,” he added. “You know, some of this is just catching people who aren't paying attention either. But, for instance, if you have a strongly favorable opinion of both Trump and Biden, chances are something's awry, and we're going to look a lot more carefully at every response.”
When it comes to political pollsters, though, one of the main techniques used to try to ensure they’re getting legit responses is fairly basic: cross-referencing with voter files. Pollsters often contact voters through the phone numbers associated with their voter file. Then, they can use the demographic information those respondents provide to verify that the person on the other end of the line is the voter they were trying to reach. Some pollsters are OK with speaking to another person in the household, but others are strict about only speaking to the intended voter. Either way, the political pollsters I spoke to all cited voter file cross-referencing as the main and best way they verify their results.
Pete Brodnitz, the founder and president of Expedition Strategies, a polling firm that has worked with political candidates, said he remembers distinctly the first time he came across an online opt-in survey during a Senate race he was working on. “A poll came out that had really squirrelly results, and I looked and realized, ‘Oh, I can just sign up myself. I can just completely make up my demographics.’ And that's ludicrous,” he said. “We realized in 2012 that if we didn't have the individual from the voter file, then it was impossible for me to know whether or not the sample I got was a representative sample.”
The problem is that none of these tactics — the IP checks, the trap questions, even the voter file matching — are foolproof, and there’s evidence that they may not be going far enough. Studies from the Pew Research Center, for example, have shown that online opt-in surveys are susceptible to large errors, particularly when surveying young adults and Hispanics. In one study, 12 percent of adults under 30 answered “yes” when asked if they were licensed to operate a nuclear submarine, and 24 percent of respondents who said they were Hispanic said they had such a license. In reality, fewer than 1 percent of Americans are licensed to operate a nuclear sub.
Pew also investigated a recent YouGov/The Economist poll where 20 percent of respondents under 30 said they believed the Holocaust “is a myth.” When Pew tried to replicate these findings with a more rigorous, probability-based mail survey, the results were wildly different: Just 3 percent of young Americans agreed with the statement denying the Holocaust. Pew has also found that online opt-in polls consistently include between 4 and 7 percent bogus respondents, introducing a measurable systematic bias.
Randy Ellison, the founder of Targoz Market Research, a public opinion and market research consulting firm, has written extensively about the shortcomings of the checks and balances put in place to weed out fraudulent survey respondents. He has found that, despite implementing industry-standard protections like trap questions, 30 percent of respondents in his 2020 polling were flagged when their IP address was checked with a fraud detection service. Fraudulent responses were also 30 percent higher in political polls than in consumer polls.
Ellison now checks all his responses for IP address fraud, something he said is common practice in the commercial polling industry. But while political pollsters use a voter-file-generated list to guard against the potential pitfalls of online opt-in surveys, Ellison said he’s not sure that’s a panacea, either.
“You're assuming that the cell phone number that's attached to that voter record is correct,” Ellison explained. But Ellison said he recently checked a list of 5,000 voter file respondents and found more than 90 percent had been “compromised,” meaning their information was available online.
Further work then needs to be done — checking to see if the phone numbers are active, and then cross-referencing the demographic information in the voter file data to ensure it matches — to truly verify the responses. “I feel like I've been shouting from the rooftops and nobody’s listening,” Ellison said. Though he said this is a common topic of discussion in commercial polling, “on the political side, nobody's really talking about it. It's a vulnerability to worry about.”
While voter-file-matched direct polling helps avoid many of the flaws of online opt-in surveys, the landscape is constantly evolving, and bad actors have more tools than ever before to trick pollsters. The best protection is likely a multi-layered approach, where no single guard is relied upon — similar to the “Swiss cheese” strategy in public health. Imagine a slice of Swiss cheese, with random holes where a fraudster can get through. But if you stack many slices of cheese, the holes get covered up by other layers, making it harder for someone to infiltrate and cause chaos.
This is the approach shrewd companies in the commercial sector are taking, according to Wilding-Brown. Those on the political side, where the stakes are even higher, may want to take note.",,,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,"NHL approves Coyotes sale, relocation to Salt Lake City",요약 없음,"The NHL is moving the team now formerly known as the  Arizona Coyotes to Utah to begin play as a new franchise next season, the league announced Thursday.
Ryan and Ashley Smith of Smith Entertainment Group bought the team and its existing hockey assets for $1.2 billion from Alex Meruelo, sources told ESPN. Meruelo had owned the Coyotes since buying the franchise for $300 million in 2019, but the league lost patience in his ability to find a long-term arena solution in Arizona and facilitated a sale.
The Smiths, who also own the NBA's Utah Jazz, initially built a relationship with commissioner Gary Bettman because they wanted an expansion franchise. However, over the past several months, the conversation changed and Bettman approached the Smiths about becoming a solution for the Coyotes instead.
According to Ryan Smith, things pivoted fast.
""I mean, if you would've told me at the beginning of the year that this is where we'd be, I'd say you were crazy,"" he told ESPN. ""It was more of: 'Can you guys pull this off? Can you really pull it off?' It looks like [the Coyotes'] situation's going to be a little longer than everyone anticipated, and [the NHL] kind of had an issue. So our response is very much like, we want to be part of the league. We think we bring a lot. We think we can add a lot. We think we can give back more than we take and help grow the sport.
""It's unprecedented. This is a different process. I don't think anyone's ever done it or seen it. But we're in. We're all-in. And I have a lot of faith in the people in Utah and how they show up for things.""
The sale was approved at a virtual NHL board of governors meeting Thursday afternoon.
""As everyone knows, Utah is a vibrant and thriving state, and we are thrilled to be a part of it,"" Bettman said in a statement Thursday. ""We are also delighted to welcome Ashley and Ryan Smith to the NHL family and know they will be great stewards of the game in Utah. We thank them for working so collaboratively with the league to resolve a complex situation in this unprecedented and beneficial way.""
The Coyotes' final home game at Mullett Arena on Wednesday night was emotional, with players and staff members pouring onto the ice for photos after a win against the Edmonton Oilers.
""It's been a hard 20 to 25 years, not knowing where home is going to be,"" said Coyotes rookie Josh Doan, son of franchise legend Shane Doan.
Players were largely kept in the dark on relocation until last Friday, when general manager Bill Armstrong met the team on the road in Edmonton. Players and coaches demanded answers in a team meeting, according to sources, and left that night understanding that the move was imminent.
The Coyotes' players, draft picks and hockey operations department will relocate to Utah, playing for a new yet-to-be-named franchise. Smith said there's a chance the team will play with a temporary name and logo for next season. SEG is using a branding agency and is canvassing the community for suggestions.
""It's OK if we take the full process and don't rush it, because we're going to have it forever,"" Smith told ESPN. ""And look, it's not ideal for me. I would love to come in and have it all picked out and ready to go.""
The Utah team will play at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, a facility the Smiths own and which is also home to the Jazz. SEG said it will work on improvements over the summer to outfit the arena for hockey, including building a hockey-specific locker room. According to Smith, the Delta Center will have 12,000 unobstructed seats for hockey games next season and SEG will work to expand after that.
""First of all, [the NHL] wanted to know if the arena can fit 17,000-plus, and that's what we've been able to confirm,"" Smith told ESPN. ""We've got some internal work to obviously do with our city and state, too. I mean, we got a lot more people coming in now, and so we need to build the infrastructure also up and around the arena. That's a really big focus of ours -- so the entrance of the arena just isn't that front door; it's the entertainment around it and that kind of a thing.""
Smith already has government support from Utah Gov. Spencer Cox. A bill was passed in the Utah state Senate to help fund a renovated entertainment district downtown in anticipation of an NHL franchise.
Meruelo, meanwhile, received $1 billion in the sale, according to sources, and will maintain the name, intellectual property and historical records of the Coyotes -- which will now be considered an inactive franchise. Meruelo will have a five-year window in which he can try to build an arena and bring a team to Arizona, for an expected price tag of $1 billion.
The extra $200 million in this week's sale will be split among NHL teams.
""I agree with Commissioner Gary Bettman and the National Hockey League, that it is simply unfair to continue to have our players, coaches, hockey front office, and the NHL teams they compete against, spend several more years playing in an arena that is not suited for NHL hockey,"" Meruelo said in a statement released Thursday.
""This is not the end for NHL hockey in Arizona. I have negotiated the right to reactivate the team within the next five years, and have retained ownership of the beloved Coyotes name, brand and logo. I remain committed to this community and to building a first-class sports arena and entertainment district without seeking financial support from the public.""
The Coyotes had been playing at 5,000-seat Mullett Arena on Arizona State University's campus since the beginning of last season as Meruelo continued his quest to find a permanent home in Arizona. Meruelo has eyed a plot in the Phoenix area and intends to win a state-run land auction for it June 27. However, according to sources, the NHL grew skeptical of the timeline and decided it needed a better solution for next season. The league also convinced Meruelo that it wasn't fair to the players to continue playing at Mullett Arena for the foreseeable future.
""The NHL's belief in Arizona has never wavered,"" Bettman said in his statement. ""We thank Alex Meruelo for his commitment to the franchise and Arizona, and we fully support his ongoing efforts to secure a new home in the desert for the Coyotes. We also want to acknowledge the loyal hockey fans of Arizona, who have supported their team with dedication for nearly three decades while growing the game.""
When NHLPA executive director Marty Walsh was hired in 2023, finding a solution for the Coyotes was among his top priorities. The players' union, like the league, became frustrated when Meruelo blew by artificial deadlines to break ground on a new arena. While the league was losing money on the Coyotes, the players were too, as the two sides have a 50-50 split on hockey-related revenue.
Smith said he was conscious of how difficult the situation has been for players but is planning a warm welcome, including inviting players to get acclimated.
""We're here for them,"" Smith told ESPN. ""We have an incredible Utah Jazz organization who are all onboard. I've got Lauri Markkanen, our All-Star, who literally sent me a picture today with him with skates on. I've got Will Hardy, our head coach, saying, 'Whatever you need.' I got [team CEO] Danny Ainge saying, 'Hey, do you want me to come down and help you?'
""I mean, that's the organization that they're being a part of. We have this saying called 'One Utah,' and they're really going to feel that.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

날짜 없음,Hall of Fame manager Whitey Herzog dies at age 92,요약 없음,"NEW YORK -- Whitey Herzog, the gruff and ingenious Hall of Fame manager who guided the St. Louis Cardinals to three pennants and a World Series title in the 1980s and perfected an intricate, nail-biting strategy known as ""Whiteyball,"" has died. He was 92.
""Whitey spent his last few days surrounded by his family. We have so appreciated all of the prayers and support from friends who knew he was very ill. Although it is hard for us to say goodbye, his peaceful passing was a blessing for him,"" his family said in a statement released by the Cardinals.
Herzog had been at Busch Stadium on April 4 for the Cardinals' home opener.
A crew-cut, pot-bellied tobacco chewer who had no patience for the ""buddy-buddy"" school of management, Herzog joined the Cardinals in 1980 and helped end the team's decade-plus pennant drought by adapting it to the artificial surface and distant fences of Busch Memorial Stadium. A typical Cardinals victory under Herzog was a low-scoring, one-run game, sealed in the final innings by a ""bullpen by committee,"" relievers who might be replaced after a single pitch, or temporarily shifted to the outfield, then brought back to the mound.
The Cardinals had power hitters in George Hendrick and Jack Clark, but they mostly relied on the speed and resourcefulness of switch-hitters Vince Coleman and Willie McGee, the acrobat fielding of shortstop and future Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith and the effective pitching of starters such as John Tudor and Danny Cox and relievers Todd Worrell, Ken Dayley and Jeff Lahti. For the '82 champions, Herzog didn't bother rotating relievers, but simply brought in future Hall of Famer Bruce Sutter to finish the job.
""[The media] seemed to think there was something wrong with the way we played baseball, with speed and defense and line-drive hitters,"" Herzog wrote in his memoir ""White Rat: A Life in Baseball,"" published in 1987. ""They called it 'Whiteyball' and said it couldn't last.""
Under Herzog, the Cards won pennants in 1982, 1985 and 1987, and the World Series in 1982, when they edged the Milwaukee Brewers in seven games. Herzog managed the Kansas City Royals to division titles in 1976-78, but they lost each time in the league championship to the New York Yankees.
""On behalf of the entire St. Louis Cardinals organization, I would like to offer our condolences to the family and many friends of Whitey Herzog,"" Cardinals chairman and chief executive officer Bill DeWitt Jr. said in a statement. ""Whitey and his teams played a big part in changing the direction of the Cardinals franchise in the early 1980s with an exciting style of play that would become known as ""Whitey Ball"" throughout baseball. Whitey loved the Cardinals, their fans, and St. Louis. He will be sorely missed.""
Overall, Herzog was a manager for 18 seasons, compiling a record of 1,281-1,125. He was named Manager of the Year in 1985 and voted into the Hall by the Veterans Committee in 2010, his plaque noting his ""stern, yet good-natured style,"" and his emphasis on speed, pitching and defense. Just before he formally entered the Hall, the Cardinals retired his uniform number, 24.
""On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my deepest condolences to Whitey's family, his friends across the game, and the fans of the Cardinals and the Royals,"" commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. 
When asked about the secrets of managing, he would reply a sense of humor and a good bullpen.
Dorrel Norman Elvert Herzog was born in New Athens, Illinois, a blue-collar community that would shape him long after he left. He excelled in baseball and basketball and was open to skipping the occasional class to take in a Cardinals game. Signed by the New York Yankees, he was a center fielder who discovered that he had competition from a prospect born just weeks before him, Mickey Mantle.
Herzog never played for the Yankees, but he did get to know manager Casey Stengel, another master shuffler of players who became a key influence. The light-haired Herzog was named ""The White Rat"" because of his resemblance to Yankees pitcher Bob ""The White Rat"" Kuzava.
As a player, Herzog batted .257 over eight seasons and played several positions. His best year was with the Baltimore Orioles in 1961, when he hit .291. He also played for the Washington Senators, Kansas City Athletics and Detroit Tigers, with whom he ended his playing career, in 1963.
""Baseball has been good to me since I quit trying to play it,"" he liked to say.
After working as a scout and coach, Herzog was hired in 1967 by the New York Mets as director of player development, with Tom Seaver and Nolan Ryan among the future stars he helped bring along. The Mets liked him well enough to designate him the successor to Gil Hodges, but when the manager died suddenly in 1972, the job went to Yogi Berra. Herzog instead debuted with the Texas Rangers the following season, finishing just 47-91 before being replaced by Billy Martin. He managed the Angels for a few games in 1974 and joined the Royals the following season, his time with Kansas City peaking in 1977 when the team finished 102-60.
Many players spoke warmly of Herzog, but he didn't hesitate to rid his teams of those he no longer wanted, dumping such Cardinals stars as outfielder Lonnie Smith and starting pitcher Joaquin Andujar. One trade worked out brilliantly: Before the 1982 season, he exchanged .300 hitting shortstop Garry Templeton, whom Herzog had chastised for not hustling, for the San Diego Padres' light-hitting Ozzie Smith, now widely regarded as the best defensive shortstop in history. Another deal was less far successful: Gold Glove first baseman Keith Hernandez, with whom Herzog had feuded, to the Mets in the middle of 1983 for pitchers Neil Allen and Rick Ownbey. Hernandez led New York to the World Series title in 1986, while Allen and Ownbey were soon forgotten.
Herzog was just as tough on himself, resigning in the middle of 1990 because he was ""embarrassed"" by the team's 33-47 record. He served as a consultant and general manager for the Los Angeles Angels in the early '90s and briefly considered managing the Boston Red Sox before the 1997 season.
If the '82 championship was the highlight of his career, his greatest blow was the '85 series. The Cardinals were up 3 games to 2 against his former team, the Royals, and in Game 6 led 1-0 going into the bottom of the ninth, with Worrell brought in to finish the job.
Jorge Orta led off and grounded an 0-2 pitch between the mound and first base. In one of the most famous blown calls in baseball history, he was ruled safe by umpire Don Denkinger, even though replays showed first baseman Jack Clark's toss to Worrell was in time. The Cardinals never recovered. Kansas City rallied for two runs to tie the series and crushed the Cards 11-0 in Game 7.
""No, I'm not bitter at Denkinger,"" Herzog told the AP years later. ""He's a good guy, he knows he made a mistake, and he's a human being. It happened at an inopportune time, but I do think they ought to have instant replay in the playoffs and World Series.""
As if testing Herzog's humor, the Hall inducted him alongside an umpire, Doug Harvey.
""I don't know why he should get in,"" Herzog joked at the time. ""Doug kicked me out of more games than any other umpire.""
Herzog is survived by Mary Lou Herzog, his wife of 71 years, children Debra, David and Jim and their spouses, nine grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

2024-04-13,'Nowhere near as angry': Sketch artists prepare for historic Trump criminal trial,"Veteran sketch artists Christine Cornell, Jane Rosenberg and Elizabeth Williams will serve as the eyes of public when Donald Trump's hush money trial begins Monday.","When veteran sketch artist Christine Cornell draws former President Donald Trump, she searches for details.
""He's got some very pretty qualities,"" Cornell said. ""I like the way his eyes have a kind of cat-like slant. I like his bushy eyebrows that are like caterpillars. I like that little pouty thing he does.""
Cornell, along with her colleagues Jane Rosenberg and Elizabeth Williams, have had dozens of opportunities to sketch Trump since he became the first former president to be arraigned on criminal charges last April, with Trump attending multiple days of his subsequent civil trials in New York. The former president has pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records in connection with a hush money payment his then-attorney Michael Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels just days before the 2016 presidential election.
Elizabeth Williams, Jane Rosenberg, and Christine Cornell are the veteran sketch artists who are tasked with depicting former President Donald Trump's 2024 criminal hush money trial.
Peter Charalambous/ABC News
For Cornell and her colleagues, capturing details like Trump's hair -- which Cornell describes as a ""helmet"" -- or his unique facial expressions -- which include a ""pissed off look"" according to Rosenberg -- has become a routine exercise.
But in interviews with ABC News, the three New York-based artists acknowledged that Trump's criminal hush money trial, scheduled to begin in lower Manhattan on Monday, carries a different weight.
Taking place in a spartan courtroom no larger than the size of a basketball court, the trial will be witnessed in person by approximately 60 reporters. Apart from a few photographs at the start of the day, cameras are banned from the room once the proceedings begin.
As a result, the task of visually portraying the trial largely rests in the hands of the three veteran sketch artists -- deadline artists in the most literal sense of the term -- whose pastels and inks will depict an unprecedented moment in American history.
""My whole life is going to revolve around this trial,"" Rosenberg said. ""My job is to capture the intangible quality ... to capture the emotion that's happening. I think an artist can do that.""
'Smooth-talking real estate tycoon'
Trump, who this year attended nearly three weeks of his civil trials in New York, has become a regular subject for the three sketch artists, who all drew their first sketches of a younger Trump in 1986 when he testified in an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL.
Trump, then the owner of the New Jersey Generals football team, presented himself as a charming witness, according to Williams and Cornell.
""He's got this swagger and charisma. He's this smooth-talking real estate tycoon,"" Williams said, describing the younger Trump as ""more subdued.""
""He was a young handsome thing back then, but still just as arrogant,"" Cornell said. ""Nowhere near as angry.""
Sketch artist Jane Rosenberg's sketch of former President Donald Trump's April 4, 2023, arraignment in his New York hush money case landed on the cover of New Yorker magazine after going viral. ""I couldn't believe it was real,"" she said.
Peter Charalambous/ABC News
According to Rosenberg, that anger was palpable last year when she sketched Trump during his New York arraignment. Her sketch of Trump glaring at prosecutors went viral online in the hours following Trump's historic court appearance, and the New Yorker put the sketch on the magazine's cover.
""He had that pissed off look -- 'I'm mad, I can't believe they're doing this, how could they' -- and I think I caught it,"" Rosenberg said.
Trump's New York hush money trial -- which is scheduled to take six to eight weeks -- will provide Cornell, Rosenberg, and Williams with repeat business by working with wire services or other news outlets. Having Trump in the courtroom on a daily basis also gives them a steady subject to refine in their sketches.
""The more I draw somebody, the more I can ace them,"" Cornell said.
They each acknowledged that they enjoy sketching the former president, whose unique features add character to their work. Rosenberg said she enjoys the expressiveness of his face and the ""crazy hair"" in his eyebrows.
""When I started in the business, someone said to me that we're like rats on a sinking ship. That was almost 50 years ago. As long as there is a need, I think I'll always be able to do this,"" sketch artist Christine Cornell said.
Peter Charalambous/ABC News
""Nobody looks like Trump,"" Rosenberg said.
Cornell added that Trump's hue -- famously described as orange -- is less intense in person, and his hair appears to be less ""artificial"" than in the past.
""I see more gray coming in on the sides. He's allowing that to happen. It's also a little thinner than it used to be,"" Cornell said.
Williams believes that the sketches of Trump's court appearances will capture a more realistic view of Trump than cameras could ever offer.
""He's posing for them. When they're gone, you really see who he really is, his real reaction, his real expression,"" Williams said. ""The words are the harmony. The illustrations are the melody. That's how you tell the complete picture.""
'The only survivors'
As outdated as a drawing might seem in today's digital world, sketch artists serve a unique purpose by distilling hours of court into a cohesive image, according to Sara W. Duke, a curator of popular and applied graphic art at the Library of Congress.
Subtle changes in expression, pivotal moments of testimony, or a remark from a judge can drastically change a jury's perception of a trial. For example, according to Duke, Timothy McVeigh -- who was convicted for killing 168 people in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing -- expressed little emotion during most of his month-long trial.
""Timothy McVeigh was stone cold until his mother testified -- and then he broke down,"" Duke said. ""If you're watching a televised trial, you might not remain interested long enough to watch that moment in time, but a courtroom artist is paid to notice the difference between somebody who refuses to show emotion and the moment in which they are compelled to show emotion.""
Predominantly using pastels for her sketches, sketch artist Jane Rosenberg accentuates her sketches with ink.
Peter Charalambous/ABC News
The work of sketch artists was driven by historical necessity, after photographers were banished from the courtroom due to the distracting nature of magnesium flash photography at the turn of the century. By 1937, the American Bar Association issued a policy prohibiting the use of still cameras and recording equipment in court. In the 1960s, a Texas businessman successfully appealed his conviction based on the presence of cameras in court, further entrenching the rules against cameras.
But that only heightened the public's appetite for court reporting, which increased in the 1960s with the expansion of network news outlets, according to Duke.
CBS News, faced with the challenge of covering the trial of Jack Ruby -- who murdered JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963 -- helped pioneer the commercial sketch artist industry by hiring Howard Brodie, a former war artist, to sketch the trial. By the 1980s, more than 18 sketch artists flowed through the New York Court system, including Cornell, Rosenberg, and Williams.
""We’re trying to capture the essence of a situation -- the essence of him being on the stand and what that tension was like so that the people at home can see what that experience was like, and they can understand the story,"" sketch artist Elizabeth Williams said about sketching former President Donald Trump when he testified in his 2024 New York civil fraud trial.
Peter Charalambous/ABC News
Asked why she began sketching trials, Cornell said, ""Out of desperation. It was a job also that immediately turned into repeat work.""
""Because I couldn't make any money being a fashion illustrator,"" Williams said.
""We're the only survivors from back then,"" Rosenberg said about herself and her two colleagues' status as veteran New York sketch artists.
'I gotta lose some weight'
As creatures of the court, Cornell, Rosenberg and Williams have drawn numerous historic figures who have had brushes with the law.
""If you're famous and you get in trouble, I'm going to be there,"" Cornell said.
Some subjects avoid being the focus of a sketch, while others play into the novelty of it, they said.
""Eddie Murphy was mocking me for drawing him. He was looking up and down, and did a little sketch of me on a Post-it,"" Rosenberg said. Murphy offered her the sketch, which Rosenberg keeps among her own sketches in her New York apartment.
""My goal is just to try to draw a picture of what's really happening there. None of us are trying to make an editorial comment,"" sketch artist Elizabeth Williams said about her sketches.
Peter Charalambous/ABC News
Others will attempt to influence their sketch.
""Leona Helmsley said, 'If my hair is that messy, my husband should divorce me,'"" Cornell recalled about the famous hotel magnate.
Rosenberg said that disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein asked if she could make his hair fuller.
Mafioso John Gotti went as far as to send men to ask courtroom artists to reduce the appearance of his double chin -- a message he reinforced by gesturing to the artists in court with his hand near his neck.
""That was intimidating,"" Rosenberg said.
MORE: 'Gotta lose some weight,' Trump says, examining sketch
Williams described a different encounter with Gotti, when he silently approached her from behind to comment on why she did not draw him with a smile.
""I just froze. I said, 'Well, I got one of you smiling at home. I will bring it in tomorrow,"" Williams recalled.
Trump has also taken some interest in the courtroom sketch artists, according to Rosenberg, who said she frequently catches glances from the former president.
During his civil fraud trial last year, the former president offered Rosenberg feedback on some sketches during a break in the proceedings.
""I gotta lose some weight,"" Trump remarked, according to Rosenberg.",,,,,,,,,,,,

2024-04-11,"Cost of goods and services continue to increase, report shows",ABC News business reporter Alexis Christoforous talks about an increase in the cost of goods and services and the likelihood of the Feds cutting interest rates.,"Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-04-09,Is AI a gateway to cheating?,"""GMA"" explores the pros and cons of artificial intelligence as the technology continues to become a part of our daily lives.","For one high school student in New Jersey, a single computer science competition fueled a mission to get more teenage girls interested in artificial intelligence, or AI.
Ishani Singh, now 17, was a freshman at High Technology High School in 2021 when she attended a state computer science competition, where she noticed she was only one of a few female students competing.
When Singh went onto compete in the regional competition, she said she was ""shocked"" to see that she was the only female student competing.
""I looked around and there were, like, zero girls, and I was like, 'OK,'"" Singh told ABC News in an interview airing on ""The Year: 2024,"" an annual special airing Dec. 26 on ABC. ""That felt a little weird.""
The experience inspired Singh, now a high school senior, to launch Girls Rule AI, which aims to empower young women to learn about AI, a term that, according to NASA, ""refers to computer systems that can perform complex tasks normally done by human-reasoning, decision making, creating, etc.""
Ishani Singh founded Girls Rule AI after attending a computer science competition where she was the only girl.
ABC News
Since the start of the organization nearly three years ago, Girls Rule AI has taught free courses on AI to over 200 girls in 25 states and six countries around the world, including Kenya and Afghanistan, according to Singh.
Gloria Mwangi, a Girls Rule AI instructor in Kenya, said she believes women working in AI-related fields could be transformative.
""In Kenya, the interest in tech and AI is definitely growing,"" Mwangi told ABC News. ""I think AI has a lot of potential to make a difference for young women here.""
Singh added that the success of her company, she believes, has been in making AI more accessible to more girls.

""I think it's just because girls are a little afraid to just start on this journey in the first place,"" Singh said of the gender difference in AI. ""So, I think by creating this community, I was able to make girls feel a little more more comfortable and just get them more confident in this field.""
Even with the progress, Singh said she feels there is a lot of work to do when it comes to getting girls interested in AI so they can go onto careers in the science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, industries.
According to the American Association of University Women, women currently make up 34% of the STEM workforce and are particularly outnumbered by men in fast-growing and high-paying fields like engineering and computer science.
""We're not at the level that we should be,"" Singh said. ""I think there should be more women in the tech field.""

Singh added that she believes the more young girls who become interested in AI, the greater the experience will be for all people who use the technology.
""If we have this growing surge of interest among girls and women in the field ... they'll be able to provide valuable input into the AI models that we're putting out into the world these days,"" she said. ""So, it's great to see that people have the same passion that I do.""

2024-04-09,"AI use for hiring, firing employees 'problematic,' NYU professor says","Author and journalist Hilke Schellmann about the use of AI by companies and her book “The Algorithm: How AI Decides Who Gets Hired, Monitored, Promoted & Fired.""","Journalist Hilke Schellmann discusses the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on hiring, monitoring, promotion and firing in her book ""The Algorithm.""
In her book, Schellmann delves into the accountability of AI and investigates its increasing presence in the workplace.
Schellmann, an Emmy Award-winning investigative reporter and assistant professor of journalism at New York University, examines the impact of AI on workplace decisions and cautions hiring managers to be more skeptical when using the technology.
She sat down with ABC News Live to discuss her new book.
ABC NEWS LIVE: It should come as no surprise that companies, large and small, are using artificial intelligence platforms and software to help them make decisions that were once the domain of HR departments. Joining us in a moment is Emmy-winning investigative reporter and professor of journalism at NYU, Hilke Schellmann.
Her new book, ""The Algorithm: How AI Decides Who Gets Hired, Monitored, Promoted and Fired [And Why We Need to Fight Back Now],"" investigates these seemingly automated tools that could potentially be weeding out current and potential employees based on some questionable criteria. So welcome Hilke. Your book, ""The Algorithm,"" delves into the ways that AI is impacting the lifecycle of employees. This will no doubt raise a lot of eyebrows here.
So if you could explain the tools employers are using and why do they warrant investigation?
HILKE SCHELLMANN: Yeah. So I think we see that, you know, most Fortune 500 companies use AI somewhere in the pipeline of hiring. So we see it a lot with résumé screeners. So if, you know, you upload your application to any of the big job platforms or you apply to, you know, employers' websites directly, often there's a resume parser that will sort of sort the resumes into the yes and into the no pile.
And then we see a lot of, you know, and that was obviously coming through the pandemic. We see a lot of one-way video interviews, where, where folks get prerecorded questions and there's no one on the other side. And then we see also video games, that, that, job seekers are asked to play to sort of understand what are their capabilities, what are their personalities, you know, are they agile? Are they are they, you know, quick, quick to learn, all of those things that, that companies want to know.
And, you know, this is all coming from a place that we see now, you know, companies get inundated with millions and millions of applications. So they feel like we need a technological solution. I've heard from lots of them, employment lawyers who said, 'Oh, yeah, we found gender discrimination in that tool. And we told the company not to use it, but the startup is still around.' So, yeah, there is a lot of tools that, unfortunately, do more harm than good.
ABC NEWS LIVE: And we also wanted to ask you about some eye-opening tests that you conducted on a specific tool, claiming to assess personality and job suitability based on voice samples. So walk us through that experiment and the surprising results.
SCHELLMANN: Yeah. So what I often think about is in, in this case, it was a one-way video interview where, you know, you get a bunch of questions and you were asked to answer them and record yourself. So I always think about like, what is with folks who maybe have an accent, who have a speech disability, and you know, what is with their audio?
When their audio does get transcribed into text, will the AI tool be fairly examining them? So I thought, you know, let's give it a little test. So I spoke to one of the tools in German, and I read the, a entry on, on Wikipedia about psychometrics. And I was surprised, you know, I sent the email out and I got an email back saying like, 'Oh, you are 73%, you know, qualified for this job.' And I was like, I didn't even say a word in English. And when I looked at the transcription, it was just gibberish. I think that really worries me. About like, you know, these are high stakes decisions, like, it matters who gets a job and why we get a job.
ABC NEWS LIVE: Right? Very clearly not a perfect science just yet. Now you spent five years on this book. You talked to job applicants, employers and whistleblowers. So what steps will need to be taken to ensure the responsible and ethical use of AI in the field of human resources?
SCHELLMANN: Yeah. So I feel, you know, there should be a lot of skeptical questions first for like the developers, like, you know, we need to have, explainability. Why would somebody reject it? Why was somebody put in the next round? And often the even the developers of the tools do not know that because these are unsupervised AI models. So I find that very problematic. We have to have explainability, transparency. So if somebody is in front of a judge, they have to explain why somebody made it into the next round.
ABC NEWS LIVE: Hilke Schellmann. This is a fascinating topic that we will be grappling with, likely for years to come. Thank you so much for your time today.
SCHELLMANN: Yeah, thank you for having me.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-04-09,"Inflation alarm, 'extraordinary' AI: 4 takeaways from Jamie Dimon's annual letter",The CEO of the nation's largest bank said economic risks remain significant.,"A booming job market, softening inflation, robust growth -- the economy has performed well by just any measure but the chief executive of the nation's largest bank is worried the U.S. still remains on the brink of a downturn.
Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, issued a sober economic forecast in his annual shareholder letter on Monday, warning that high inflation may prove more stubborn than expected, triggering rate hikes at the Federal Reserve and an eventual recession.
The billionaire financier also offered up a sweeping assessment of artificial intelligence and waded into an ongoing controversy over diversity, equity and inclusion.
Here are four takeaways from Dimon's annual shareholder letter:
1. Sticky inflation
Dimon acknowledged strong economic performance of late but cautioned of long-term trends that could undermine the gains. He raised special alarm about the economy's top threat: inflation.
Inflation has fallen significantly from a peak of 9.1%, but it remains more than a percentage point higher than the Fed's target rate of 2%.
A host of factors, including government spending and global trading shocks, could make the final leg of inflation's path down to normal levels much more difficult than many observers expect, Dimon said.
Other trends keeping inflation higher, he added: ascendant military conflict and the loans required for the transition to a climate-friendly economy.
The risks posed by ongoing inflation imperil efforts to achieve a ""soft landing,"" in which inflation returns to normal levels while the economy averts a recession, Dimon said.
""These markets seem to be pricing in at a 70% to 80% chance of a soft landing,"" he added. ""I believe the odds are a lot lower than that.""
2. Interest rates could soar
In recent months, the Fed has forecasted a series of highly anticipated interest rate cuts. Instead, the central bank may end up doing the opposite, Dimon said.
The Fed Funds rate stands between 5.25% and 5.5%, matching its highest level since 2001.
In response to potentially stubborn inflation, interest rates could soar past 8%, Dimon said.
Rate hikes would increase borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, potentially slowing economic activity through weaker household spending and company investment.
The ensuing economic stagnation could push the U.S. into a recession, Dimon warned.
A potential spike in interest rates could pose a broader threat than the crisis that befell Silicon Valley Bank and other regional banks last year, Dimon added.
""The mini banking crisis of 2023 is over, but beware of higher rates and recession -- not just for banks but for the whole economy,"" Dimon said.
3. Artificial intelligence could end up being as significant as the printing press
Dimon, who said JPMorgan Chase uses artificial intelligence in about 400 different ways, touted the technology as a breakthrough on the scale of some of humanity's most influential inventions.
""While we do not know the full effect or the precise rate at which AI will change our business -- or how it will affect society at large -- we are completely convinced the consequences will be extraordinary and possibly as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years: Think the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the Internet, among others,"" Dimon said.
The stock market has climbed since the outset of last year, driven in large part by a group of major tech companies propelled by enthusiasm over AI.
Shares of Nvidia, a California-based firm that sells the majority of chips behind the AI boom, climbed nearly 500% since the beginning of 2023. Microsoft, part-owner of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has seen its stock price jump about 75% over that period.
JPMorgan Chase, meanwhile, has invested heavily in the technology, hiring roughly 2,000 machine-learning specialists and data scientists, and exploring avenues to incorporate the technology into every job at the firm, Dimon said.
4. Support for diversity, equity and inclusion
Diversity, equity and inclusion programs have become a lightning rod, stoking controversy in state capitals and corporate boardrooms.
In a section of the letter, Dimon advocated for the importance of DEI, outlining several initiatives at the bank aimed at supporting employees and customers who belong to marginalized groups.
Dimon touted affinity groups within the company devoted to connecting workers of various identities, such as Black or LGBTQ+ employees. He also promoted a company program called Women on the Move, which pursues the career advancement of women employees.
In 2020, JPMorgan Chase pledged to spend $30 billion over a five-year span to close the racial wealth gap. The company has nearly completed the initiative, Dimon said, announcing that JPMorgan Chase would continue the program as part of its normal operations.
""We believe that companies, and banks in particular, must earn the trust of the communities and countries in which they operate,"" Dimon said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-04-09,"US, Japan to make 'historic' announcements at summit, including on defense and AI: Official",President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida hold talks on Wednesday.,"When President Joe Biden hosts Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the White House for an official visit Wednesday, a senior administration official tells ABC News the two countries will make ""historic"" announcements that will take the U.S.-Japan alliance to ""new heights.""
This official said the leaders will unveil more than 70 programs and initiatives. Many of the announcements will focus on deepening defense ties, furthering cooperation between Japan and other allies, and new updates on Japan's efforts to acquire Tomahawk land attack missiles from the U.S.
The summit is also expected to include steps that would allow the countries to work on joint development -- and potentially co-production -- of vital military and defense equipment, according to Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell in remarks last week.
There will also be new cooperation in space, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and climate change, the official said.

The leaders are expected to discuss a wide range of topics, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
The visit underscores how the mutual threat from China, North Korea and Russia are driving these two allies even closer together. The two countries want to deter China and prepare for any conflict that could emerge. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has made Japan more worried about China trying to move on Taiwan.
A state visit is a huge honor, and it signals to the world how close the relationship is and marks milestones in the relationship.

How did the state visit come about?
Prime Minister Kishida and President Biden have met nearly a dozen times since Kishida took office about two and a half years ago. The official says they ""have a very warm personal and working relationship.""
The official added that Biden and national security adviser Jake Sullivan expressed interest in hosting Kishida after the president saw him at Camp David for the historic trilateral summit last August with the U.S., Japan, and South Korea.
The president, the official said, felt ""strongly"" about wanting to ""honor a friend"" who has shown ""courage"" in resolving past tensions with North Korea, stepping up support to Ukraine, and someone who has been ""bucking a lot of conventions"" in Japanese politics and foreign policy, the official said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

2024-04-05,What's after AI? The next watershed technology could be quantum computing,"""Companies are betting billions of dollars on this field,"" one expert said.","Artificial intelligence commands the attention of corporate giants and political leaders but a global race is underway to develop what some experts consider the next transformative technology: quantum computing.
The computers, which draw on theoretical physics, could drive advances in everything from drug research to stock investing to encryption, promising an economic boon for the companies and nations that lead its development, some experts told ABC News.
Google, Microsoft and Intel are among the companies trying to achieve breakthroughs in quantum computing. Tech firm IBM announced on Friday its first-ever quantum computer on a university campus, unveiling the machine at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, or RPI, which is located in Troy, New York.
Here's what to know about how quantum computing works, why the technology matters and what's significant about the new machine at RPI:
What is quantum computing?
Quantum computing uses the principles of abstract physics to supercharge a machine's computational horsepower well beyond what's found in an everyday computer.
The next-generation technology stands in contrast with classical computing, or binary computing, which relies on tiny units of data called bits. Those bits are oriented as either ones or zeroes, indicating on/off switches that make up the basic inputs of any task performed by a computer.
On the other hand, quantum computing draws on a fundamental concept of quantum physics known as ""superposition,"" which means a single entity can occupy multiple states at the same time, Daniel Lidar, a professor of engineering at the University of Southern California, told ABC News.
""In some sense, this is one computer performing many calculations all at once,"" Lidar said. ""In a standard case, you'd need lots of computers performing simultaneous calculations.""
Three decades ago, a physicist named Peter Shor proved that quantum computing could break a common form of internet encryption within just a few hours; whereas a standard computer would take billions of years to achieve the same task, Lidar added.
""Ever since that discovery, there's been a worldwide race to build these computers,"" Lidar said.

What's at stake with the development of quantum computing?
The countries and firms that develop quantum computing stand to gain a significant advantage in an array of lucrative industries, some experts told ABC News.
Consulting firm McKinsey & Company identified four industries most likely to see early economic impact from quantum computing: automotive, chemicals, financial services and life sciences, according to a report last year. Across those four industries, the technology could add a combined $1.3 trillion in value by 2035, the report said.
In 2022, President Joe Biden visited IBM's quantum data center in Poughkeepsie, New York, which features the world's largest collection of quantum computers, the company said in a news release at the time.
""The government that will hold the first truly useful quantum computer will have a power at its fingertips that is breathtaking,"" Lidar said. ""That's why many governments are heavily invested and companies are betting billions of dollars on this field.""
While thousands of researchers worldwide work out the kinks of quantum computing, concrete applications remain 5 to 10 years away, Lidar said.
What is the significance of the new quantum computer at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute?
The IBM quantum computer at RPI marks the first of its kind on a university campus.
The machine will help students push quantum computing from experimental uses to real-life applications, Jay Gambetta, IBM fellow and vice president of Quantum Computing, told ABC News.
""Getting quantum computing into their hands is essential for us to create this industry,"" Gambetta said.
Thirty percent of the university's sophomore class major in computer programming, RPI President Martin Schmidt told ABC News. The newly unveiled quantum computer will equip them with direct training in one of the latest advancements in the tech field, he added.
""Everybody's going to be scrambling for talent,"" he said. ""There are going to be some people that just really make this thing sing. And I want to see that magic happen.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-04-05,Can AI improve your experience at the doctor's office?,ABC News' Rebecca Jarvis looks at artificial intelligence's role in the medical field and how it's allowing doctors to expand their research and make decisions for patients.,"Nearly 12 years ago, Jessie Owen's life changed forever.
""My family was going over a mountain pass and a tree fell on our car. In that moment, my parents passed away, my siblings were severely injured, and I became quadriplegic,"" Owen said. ""I lost my independence. I lost my job. I lost my apartment. I lost my autonomy and the life that I dreamed for myself.""
Like Owen, more than 300,000 people live with spinal cord injuries in the United States, with an estimated 18,000 new cases each year, data shows.
Motor vehicle accidents account for the majority of spinal cord injuries and are closely followed by falls, acts of violence and sports activities, according to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center.
Jessie Owen was left paralyzed nearly 12 years ago when a tree fell on a car in which she was a passenger.

For years, options for recovery have been limited, but a newly FDA-cleared external spinal stimulator, ARC-EX Therapy, which received clearance on Dec. 19, may offer hope for people like Owen.
""ARC-EX is simply electrodes attached to skin on the back of the neck,"" explained Chet Moritz, Ph.D., a professor of rehabilitation medicine at the University of Washington. ""It allows us to pass current through the skin to activate the sensory nerves as they enter the spinal cord. Now, those sensory nerves make direct connections to the motor nerves which help people to move.""

Owen, who participated in the Up-LIFT study, a clinical trial focusing on the health benefits of ARC-EX Therapy, saw a life-changing impact.
""I was wildly surprised and pleased to see that it was making meaningful change in my life. I can now paint with my hands. I can open a jar of peanut butter. I can tie my shoes. It [used to] take me 30 minutes to get dressed. Now it takes 12. [I used to require] 20 caregiving hours a week and I was able to move down to about eight.""
Jessie Owen was left paralyzed nearly 12 years ago when a tree fell on a car in which she was a passenger.

The Up-LIFT study produced promising results.
Of the 60 patients with cervical spinal cord injuries studied, 72% saw improvements in hand strength and function. Participants also reported fewer muscle spasms, better sleep, less pain, and improved independence during daily activities.
""The success of [this] study of people with spinal cord injuries is phenomenal,"" noted Moritz. ""There are essentially no current therapies for chronic spinal cord injury, and so having the majority of patients respond in both strength and function measures [is] just an outstanding result.""

With FDA approval, ARC-EX Therapy is expected to become more accessible.
""Patients can work with their local rehabilitation clinics to see a therapist and work with them in the clinic at first to tune the device,"" Moritz said. Results may appear quickly -- some participants noticed changes within just a few sessions, he added.
While the device is currently cleared for improving hand strength, function and sensation, Moritz noted other benefits: ""Some people will have modest improvements in their bladder function, heart rate, or blood pressure control.""
Leah Croll, M.D., vascular neurologist at Maimonides Health and assistant professor of neurology at SUNY Downstate, shared the excitement over the device.
""The idea that ARC-EX Therapy may accelerate or augment neurologic recovery is really exciting. Any improvement in neurologic function is meaningful and has far-reaching impact in the daily lives of these patients and their families,"" she said.
The road to recovery after a spinal cord injury is grueling, Croll said.
""After emergency and ICU care is completed, the mainstay of treatment is working closely with physical therapists, occupational therapists and other rehabilitation professionals to support neurologic recovery,"" said Croll. ""Patients may also need medications and certain procedures, depending on their unique symptoms.""
For Owen and others, ARC-EX Therapy represents a renewed sense of hope and an exciting change in the way these patients can be treated.
""[With ARC-EX Therapy], I continued to gain function back, and I found I was able to pour more into other people,"" Owen said. ""The first indicator of success that I noticed was my own happiness. It works, and it gives us hope and passion.""

2024-04-05,"Review: 'The Beast' checks off all the boxes: smart, sexy, scary, thrilling","It’s a pleasure to recommend a film of startling originality, dazzle and danger.","In a multiplex dominated by limp reboots of ""Ghostbusters"" and the team of Godzilla and King Kong, it's a pleasure to recommend a film of startling originality, dazzle and danger. It's called ""The Beast."" It's in theaters right now, and you've never seen anything like it in your life.
""The Beast"" checks off all the boxes: smart, sexy, scary, thrilling and highlighted by career-best performances from Léa Seydoux (""Dune, Part Two"") and George MacKay (""1917"") as lovers across space and time who try to kill their feelings for each other without killing their humanity.
The film starts 20 years into the future when artificial intelligence is ready to wipe out fear by eliminating pain from the human equation. Why should we worry when it's easier to transform into zonked out zombies impervious to emotions that make us feel things too deeply -- or at all?

Vertigo Releasing/YouTube
If that sounds a lot like the here and now, you're onto the game being played by brilliant writer-director Bertrand Bonello. Using the 1903 Henry James short story ""The Beast in the Jungle"" as a springboard, Bonello walks the tightrope of imagination without a net as romantic partners keep falling hard for different incarnations of themselves.
Dread is the mood set and fixed in a prologue as Seydoux, playing an actress named Gabrielle, stands against a green screen while a voice directs her to act frightened as if a beast she and we cannot see approaches. Still, there's no mistaking the fear in Gabrielle's eyes -- it's real.

And so is the purification process imposed by AI to rid her of traumatic memories in her present and past lives. Then, whoosh, it's 1910, where Gabrielle, now the pianist wife of dollmaker Georges (Martin Scali) is at a posh party attended by Louis (MacKay), a handsome aristocrat who vows to protect her, especially from the beast she can't get out of her head.
Even the great flood of Paris, with Georges' studio awash with floating dolls with scary, saucer eyes, can't compare to the threat that awaits Gabrielle in 2014, where as a struggling Hollywood actress she meets Louis. This time, he's an incel, an involuntary celibate who can't find a sexual partner despite desiring one, driven by violent thoughts against women.
Léa Seydoux and George MacKay star in ""The Beast"" movie.

The scenes where Louis stalks Gabrielle through the Los Angeles mansion she's housesitting are the film's most terrifying and yet achingly tender, since Louis' love is never in doubt, only his tragic confusion about how to express it.
Bonello uses everything in his artistic palette to show the evil of AI as an instrument to detach us from the emotional highs and lows that make us human. My advice about ""The Beast"" is to not overthink it. Just jump in and surrender to its surreal dreamscape. Any lapses in clarity seem a small price to pay for the adventure that awaits you.

Ishani Singh, now 17, was a freshman at High Technology High School in 2021 when she attended a state computer science competition, where she noticed she was only one of a few female students competing.
When Singh went onto compete in the regional competition, she said she was ""shocked"" to see that she was the only female student competing.
""I looked around and there were, like, zero girls, and I was like, 'OK,'"" Singh told ABC News in an interview airing on ""The Year: 2024,"" an annual special airing Dec. 26 on ABC. ""That felt a little weird.""
The experience inspired Singh, now a high school senior, to launch Girls Rule AI, which aims to empower young women to learn about AI, a term that, according to NASA, ""refers to computer systems that can perform complex tasks normally done by human-reasoning, decision making, creating, etc.""

Gloria Mwangi, a Girls Rule AI instructor in Kenya, said she believes women working in AI-related fields could be transformative.
""In Kenya, the interest in tech and AI is definitely growing,"" Mwangi told ABC News. ""I think AI has a lot of potential to make a difference for young women here.""
Singh added that the success of her company, she believes, has been in making AI more accessible to more girls.

""I think it's just because girls are a little afraid to just start on this journey in the first place,"" Singh said of the gender difference in AI. ""So, I think by creating this community, I was able to make girls feel a little more more comfortable and just get them more confident in this field.""
Even with the progress, Singh said she feels there is a lot of work to do when it comes to getting girls interested in AI so they can go onto careers in the science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, industries.
According to the American Association of University Women, women currently make up 34% of the STEM workforce and are particularly outnumbered by men in fast-growing and high-paying fields like engineering and computer science.
""We're not at the level that we should be,"" Singh said. ""I think there should be more women in the tech field.""

The two leaders were set to speak about climate change, the economic relationship between the U.S. and China as well as progress on artificial intelligence and countering illegal drug flow, such as fentanyl, according to a senior administration official.
Officials downplayed expectations ahead of Tuesday's call, describing it as a ""check in"" amid the administration's efforts to ""maintain regular open lines of communication to responsibly manage competition and prevent unintended consequences.""
Though the call between Biden and Xi Jinping lasted 105 minutes, an administration official told ABC News, longer than previous phone conversations between the two leaders.

Her trip will focus on pressuring her Chinese counterparts on those trade practices as well as expanding cooperation between the U.S. and China against illicit finance and progressing work on shared priorities like financial stability and addressing climate change, according to a senior Treasury official.
""The two leaders welcomed ongoing efforts to maintain open channels of communication and responsibly manage the relationship through high-level diplomacy and working-level consultations in the weeks and months ahead, including during upcoming visits by Secretary Yellen and Secretary Blinken,"" the White House said.

China has economic reasons to engage more with the U.S. as it's economy is in a downturn and Xi wants to restore confidence in its market and attract more foreign investment. Just last week, the Chinese president met with a delegation of American CEOs in Beijing.
The readouts of Tuesday's call from both countries underscored the litany of areas where the two leaders still fundamentally disagree. Beijing believes that Biden's policies are ""suppressing"" China and its economy.
One of Xi's biggest concerns is around U.S. exports of advanced chips. Notably, the Chinese readout accuses the U.S. of ""suppressing China's high-tech development"" and threatens that ""we will not stand idly by"" if the U.S. continues to do so.
The Biden administration has described its economic restrictions on China as a ""small yard, high fence"" strategy. That means they place strict curbs on a few areas that have important military applications, while keeping regular economic relations in other areas.

Kennedy Jr's running mate in his independent presidential bid, she tells ABC News","Former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who left the Democratic Party in 2022, declined an offer to be Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s running mate in his independent presidential bid, she tells ABC News.
""I met with Kennedy several times, and we have become good friends,"" she said in a statement. ""He asked if I would be his running mate. After careful consideration, I respectfully declined.""
Gabbard declined to explain why she turned down that offer, which has not previously been reported.
She is among an eclectic group of people whom Kennedy had considered for the role, including former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura and TV host Mike Rowe.
He announced at an Oakland, California, rally last week that he had chosen Silicon Valley lawyer Nicole Shanahan, whose younger age, work in health and artificial intelligence appealed to him.
Kennedy and his campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Gabbard's statement. However, a person close to him told ABC News, ""There were definitely meetings, but it didn't work out.""
""We talked to a bunch of people,"" this person added. ""Tulsi's a rock star no matter what.""
Gabbard's name has also been floated by some allies of former President Donald Trump to be his potential vice-presidential pick.
She ran an unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic presidential nominee in 2019 before departing the party three years later, an exit she chronicled in a book she is releasing this month, ""For Love of Country: Leave the Democrat Party Behind.""

In announcing she would no longer be a Democrat, Gabbard blamed ""warmongers"" in the party ""who are driven by cowardly wokeness, who divide us by racializing every issue.""
However, she had also become increasingly out of step with the party's mainstream, including on issues like Florida's controversial ban on LGBTQ+ topics in some public school classrooms, which she supported.
During her White House run, Gabbard made history when she became the first woman of color since 1972 to net a delegate to the Democratic National Convention.
Gabbard is also a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves who was deployed twice to Iraq and Kuwait and took a two-week absence from the presidential campaign trail in 2020 to report for active duty in Indonesia with the Hawaiian Army National Guard.
As a member of Congress, Gabbard drew scrutiny after she traveled to Syria in 2017, saying that she was going to see how U.S. policies were directly impacting Syrians. While there, she met with religious leaders and accepted a meeting with Syria's autocratic president, Bashar al-Assad, amid the country's still-ongoing civil war.
She defended her meeting, which she insisted she did in the pursuit of peace, despite backlash from some other Democratic lawmakers.
The former congresswoman also drew criticisms after she voted ""present"" during the House's formal impeachment vote against then-President Donald Trump in 2019.
At the time Gabbard said that her vote was an ""active protest"" against the ""terrible fallout of this zero-sum mindset"" between the two political parties.

Chris Barr was the very first patient in a Mayo Clinic study that collected stem cells from his own stomach fat, expanded them in a laboratory to 100 million cells and then injected the cells into Barr's lumbar spine.
Over five years after undergoing the therapy, Barr said he is continuing to gain more independence and get faster at walking.
""I never dreamed I would have a recovery like this,"" Barr told ABC News' Will Reeve. ""I can feed myself. I can walk around. I can do day-to-day independent activities.""
Barr shared an update with Reeve on his own progress as Mayo Clinic published new data showing the success of the stem cell treatment in a clinical trial involving 10 patients, including Barr.

According to the trial's results, published Monday in the journal Nature Communications, seven of the 10 patients experienced increased strength in muscle motor groups and increased sensation to pinpricks and light touch.

Three patients in the study had no response to the stem cell therapy, meaning they did not get better or worse, according to the Mayo Clinic, based in Rochester, Minnesota.
""These findings give us hope for the future,"" Dr. Mohamad Bydon, a neurosurgeon and spinal cord researcher at the Mayo Clinic and the study's lead author, told Reeve, who is also the director of The Christopher Reeve Foundation, a nonprofit ""dedicated to curing spinal cord injury,"" according to its website. The foundation, named in honor of Will Reeve's late father, was not involved in the funding of Bydon's research.
Bydon's research at the Mayo Clinic is a Phase 1 study that began in 2018.
The newly published results of the study show that of the seven patients who saw improvement after the stem cell therapy, each moved up at least one level on the American Spinal Injury Association -- or ASIA -- Impairment Scale, which has five levels documenting patients' function.
""This trial shows us that stem cells are safe and potentially beneficial in the treatment of spinal cord injury,"" Bydon said. ""This can be a milestone in our field of neurosurgery, neuroscience and of treating patients with spinal cord injury.""
There is currently no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for spinal cord injury.

Bydon and other researchers are still trying to understand how and why the stem cells interact with the spinal cord to result in progress for some patients, and additional research is underway among a larger group of people to further assess risks and benefits.
In Barr's case, he told Reeve in 2019 he began to quickly see improvements, like getting feeling back in his legs, after undergoing the stem cell treatment.

Now five years later, he described making further long-term improvements, like being able to walk for consistent intervals without assistance.

2024-03-29,Beyoncé's country-inspired album 'Cowboy Carter' has finally arrived,"Beyoncé's eighth studio album, ""Cowboy Carter,"" is available worldwide now.","Beyoncé’s eighth studio album, ""Cowboy Carter,"" is available worldwide now.
The long-awaited 27-track project arrived Friday. ""I think people are going to be surprised because I don’t think this music is what everyone expects,"" she said. ""But it’s the best music I’ve ever made.""
The superstar already had a smash on her hands with ""Texas Hold 'Em,"" which made Beyoncé the first woman and first Black woman to have topped both the Hot Country Songs and Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs since the lists began in 1958, according to Billboard.
The lead track, released along with ""16 Carriages"" on Feb. 11, also spent four weeks at the top of the U.K. music charts.
Beyoncé said, ""The joy of creating music is that there are no rules. The more I see the world evolving the more I felt a deeper connection to purity. With artificial intelligence and digital filters and programming, I wanted to go back to real instruments, and I used very old ones.""

2024-03-29,The stock market has skyrocketed to start 2024. Will it continue?,The S&P 500 has climbed 10% this year.,"The stock market has surged out of the gate in 2024.
The S&P 500 -- the index that most people's 401(k)'s track -- reached a record high on Wednesday, putting the index up 10% this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has followed close behind with 9% growth over that period, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has jumped more than 5%.
Markets have benefited from a flurry of good news: stronger-than-expected economic growth, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, cooling inflation and anticipated interest rate cuts at the Federal Reserve, experts told ABC News.
“All of those things are coming into alignment right now,” Marc Dizard, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group, told ABC News.
MORE: Trump's Truth Social stock is soaring as the company loses money. Here's why.
But the good times may not last, experts said, predicting a downturn in the coming months that could erase some of the gains.
“It wouldn’t surprise me if we have some sort of correction in the spring or summer,” Dizard added.
Despite straining under the weight of the highest interest rates in two decades, the U.S. economy has sustained solid growth.
U.S. job gains far exceeded expectations in February, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data earlier this month showed.
Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, grew at a robust 3.3% annual rate over the final three months of last year, according to data from the U.S. Commerce Department.
The flex of economic muscle has helped lift the stock market skyward, extending the gains well beyond typical top performers like tech firms or large corporations, Bret Kenwell, an investing analyst at eToro, told ABC News.
“There’s strength across the board,” Kenwell said.
Still, that broad-based performance has been accompanied by a stellar run among the group of corporate giants that make up the so-called “Magnificent Seven”: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia.
Those companies have surged in large part due to enthusiasm about AI, experts said. Microsoft, for instance, holds a major stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI; while Nvidia produces the majority of chips behind the AI boom.
In this Jan. 9, 2024, file photo, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella speaks during CES 2024 in Las Vegas.

Nvidia has climbed 83% so far this year, a rate more than eightfold faster than the S&P 500. Microsoft has jumped 11%.
“There is a lot of hope around AI,” John DiFucci, a tech analyst at asset management firm Guggenheim, told ABC News.
The Federal Reserve, another source of optimism driving markets higher, said at a meeting earlier this month that a rough patch for inflation has not altered its plans for three interest rate cuts this year.
Inflation has fallen significantly from a peak of 9.1% but it remains more than a percentage point higher than the Fed's target rate of 2%.
Interest rate cuts would lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, potentially triggering a burst of economic activity through greater household spending and company investment.
“Rate cuts are at the front of people’s minds,” Kenwell said. “Between the Fed’s rate cuts and the underlying fundamentals, it’s all playing a big role.
Despite benefiting from positive economic trends, the market will likely turn downward in the coming months as traders balk at the high prices and firms struggle to preserve the gains, experts said.
MORE: AI is driving a stock market rally. What if the technology falters?
If inflation runs hotter than expected, the Fed may keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated. That outcome, they said, would put downward pressure on markets.
“It would be realistic to expect some sort of dip,” Kenwell said. “The magnitude really is the question.”
Dizard, of PNC, agreed. The market could decline as much as 5% or 10% in the coming months, he said.
“That being said, I’ll take a 10% gain in the first quarter of the year,” Dizard added. “I love that.”",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-03-28,Baltimore's Key Bridge may have lacked collision protective measures for modern cargo ships: Experts,Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge partially collapsed early Tuesday morning after a massive cargo ship collided with one of the bridge's support columns.,"In the wake of the collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, engineering and infrastructure policy experts explained the critical need for bridge reform in the United States and an international standard for large cargo ships.
The Key Bridge partially collapsed early Tuesday morning after a massive cargo ship collided with one of the bridge's support columns, sending vehicles into the Patapsco River below and leaving six people unaccounted for, according to officials.
In an aerial view, cargo ship Dali is seen after running into and collapsing the Francis Scott Key Bridge, March 26, 2024, in Baltimore.

The investigation into the cause of both the collision and the bridge collapse is ongoing, officials said.
MORE: What we know about Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse
Rick Geddes, infrastructure policy expert and director of the Cornell University Infrastructure Policy Program, weighed in on the infrastructure and safety of the Key Bridge.
""This disaster reveals how exposed America's critical infrastructure is to sudden and devastating accidents as well as intentional destruction,"" Geddes said in a statement to ABC News. ""I think the bridge was not designed to take the force and the mass of an enormous cargo ship directly hitting one of the pylons,"" Geddes said in an interview with ABC News.
Pylons, or piers, are the critical load-bearing components of cable-supported bridges, such as Baltimore's Key Bridge, a 1.6-mile-long, continuous truss-style bridge, according to Geddes.
Modern protective measures for bridge piers include adding ""fenders,"" which are protection systems designed to protect the bridge from vessels transiting under or in the vicinity of the bridge, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.
Fenders on modern bridges include ""dolphins,"" which are large circular walls filled with material such as sand or concrete and ""artificial islands,"" armored artificial islands around the piers made of a sand core that is protected against wave and current action by armored slope protection, according to the Coast Guard.
However, it is not yet known whether or not the Baltimore Key Bridge had fenders at the time of the crash.
The Maryland Transportation Authority did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for a comment.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg also weighed in on the bridge's ability to withstand a massive cargo ship collision Wednesday, ""What we do know is a bridge like this one completed in the 1970s was simply not made to withstand a direct impact on a critical support pier from a vessel that weighs about 200 million pounds,"" he said during a press briefing.
""Right now, I think there's a lot of debate taking place in the engineering community about whether or not any of those features could have had any role in a situation like this,"" Buttigieg added.
The 984-feet-long and 157-feet-wide cargo ship -- operated by Synergy Marine Group and named Dali -- was moving at a speed of 8 knots, or about 9 mph, when it struck the bridge, according to officials.

""So it's a tremendous force, that the bridge would have to be designed to absorb,"" Geddes said, adding, ""It clearly was not designed to take that.""
Construction of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge began in 1972 and finished in March 1977, according to the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA).
MORE: The history of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge
Maria Lehman, former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, told ABC News that older bridges are not designed with the post Panama Canal expansion ship allowances in mind.
In 2016, the Panama Canal expansion project constructed pathways -- on both the Atlantic and Pacific ends of the canal -- that are 70 feet wider and 18 feet deeper, to accommodate larger cargo ships.
Lehman said because Baltimore's Key Bridge was created with smaller cargo ships in mind, it was ""inadequate for what we see with ships today.""
MORE: Panama Canal's low water levels could become headache for consumers
""Pier protection on long-span bridges that have been built within the last decade are in line with what you're gonna need based on how heavy these new ships are,"" Lehman said.
Lehman said the news of the Key Bridge collapse Tuesday reminded her of the 1980 Sunshine Skyway Bridge collapse in Tampa, Florida, which she said was a ""very similar"" bridge and spurred a ""base standard for pier protection"" in the United States.
In May 1980, the M/V Summit Venture freighter struck a support beam on the Skyway Bridge causing a major collapse that left 35 people dead. The now 44-year-old tragedy spurred changes to the engineering of bridges that have been built since, according to Lehman.
Three years after the Skyway Bridge incident, the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration released a technical advisory titled ""Pier Protection and Warning Systems for Bridges Subject to Ship Collisions""
In the 1983 advisory, the agency noted, ""It may be extremely difficult to retrofit some existing bridge piers with protective systems. For this reason, it becomes particularly important to recognize the potential hazards from ship collisions and to locate and design piers on new bridges in such a way that the risks of collision are reduced to an acceptable level.""

Baltimore's Key Bridge was constructed in 1977 and did not have the protected pier measures that bridges built in the decades since this advisory.
""Unless you're doing a major retrofit of any piece of infrastructure, you don't have to bring it up to code,"" Lehman said, adding that the Key Bridge collapse is a ""wake-up"" call for better bridge infrastructure and reform.
""I think just like Sunshine Skyway was a wake-up call, I think this is the next wake-up call,"" Lehman said, adding, ""We're going to have to take a look closely at the results of what happened, and then work on the plan. So it never happens again.""
In June 2023, Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA) officials announced the construction of the Delaware Memorial Bridge Protection System.
""Our goal is to take preemptive measures to prevent a commercial vessel from striking one of the bridge towers, which could cause significant damage to the bridge infrastructure and disruptions to interstate travel,"" Thomas J. Cook, executive director of the DRBA said in a press release.
The cost of the project is nearly $93 million, according to the release.
Rick Geddes hopes the devastation from the Key Bridge collapse will spur great reform in America's bridge infrastructure safety.
""The real possibility of a massive container ship of this size, running into a bridge pylon, and causing the bridge collapse is no longer theoretical,"" Geddes said. ""I think a renewed effort to inspect and assess the state of a whole bunch of U.S. bridges will be the result of this accident.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-03-28,States are cracking down on deepfakes ahead of the 2024 election,How artificial intelligence and deepfakes could impact the 2024 election.,"The recording sounded an awful lot like President Joe Biden. In a robocall made to thousands of New Hampshire residents ahead of the state's presidential primary in January, an artificial-intelligence-generated dupe of the president's voice urged voters not to bother with the primary. NBC News later reported the audio was a complete fabrication created by a New Orleans street magician who said he was hired by Steve Kramer, a Democratic operative who has worked on Rep. Dean Phillips's presidential campaign.
There are still a lot of lingering questions about this scandal, but the biggest may be: How worried should we be about AI-generated fakery this election? In an attempt to get out in front of the problem, state legislators have been introducing and passing bans on deepfakes — media created using AI to impersonate politicians — around elections. Since January of last year, 41 states have introduced election-related deepfake bans, according to tracking by Public Citizen. Eight states have enacted laws regulating deepfakes, joining California and Texas, which in 2019 banned the use of deepfakes in elections. But these laws miss some of the AI threats experts say are most pressing and demonstrate how difficult it is to legislate this emerging technology while preserving First Amendment rights.
Deepfakes first emerged more than six years ago and — like so much of the internet — were originally used to generate porn. But the arrival over the last year of commercially available and easy-to-use AI platforms such as ChatGPT and DALL-E has made this technology much more accessible, creating new opportunities — and new threats. This is likely what spurred the sudden cascade of deepfake bans at the state level, said Daniel Weiner, the director of elections and government at the Brennan Center for Justice.
""Reasonably convincing deepfakes are easier for ordinary people who don't have a lot of resources or a lot of technical skill to create,"" Weiner said, adding that AI is a ""threat amplifier"" that has exacerbated existing risks to democracy, such as disinformation (risks that have also increased since 2020 for reasons unrelated to AI).
The new state laws vary in exactly how they approach the problem of misleading, AI-generated content around elections. A law enacted last week in Wisconsin, for instance, requires any campaign audio or video content that includes AI-generated media to include a clear disclaimer. A law enacted in New Mexico earlier this month also requires disclaimers, while making it a crime if a deepfake is used within 90 days of an election with the intent of altering the voting behavior of the electorate. (Something like the Biden deepfake might fall under this.)
Some lawmakers have argued laws like this are infringing on freedom of expression — so legislators sometimes have to thread the needle between protecting free speech and preventing misleading content from interfering with elections. For instance, a Georgia bill that passed the state House in February would make it a felony to ""publish, broadcast, stream or upload"" a deepfake within 90 days of an election with the intention of impacting the election or misleading voters — but it also specifically carves out exemptions for satire, parody, journalism and campaign ads so long as they include a disclaimer. The bill had bipartisan support in the state House, but some legislators still worried it infringed on freedom of speech, with one Republican state legislator saying it ""threatens to erode the bedrock of freedom.""
The carveouts written to thread that needle can also make the laws too specific and cause them to miss some of the other risks to democracy that AI creates, according to Josh Lawson, the director of AI and democracy at the Aspen Institute. While state and federal laws have primarily focused on deepfakes that impersonate politicians, experts like Lawson are more concerned about other types of deceptive content, such as using AI to generate mass texting campaigns that target voters with custom misinformation to, for example, tell them their polling location has changed. This kind of tactic predates AI (just ask any Canadian), but the new technology makes it easier and more precise.
During a recent briefing with the National Association of Secretaries of State, Lawson and other experts presented attendees with six AI risk scenarios that threaten democracy, and none of them had to do with politicians being impersonated. Instead, they included fake local news sites, AI-augmented phishing schemes to gain access to election systems, or voice cloning to imitate local election officials and disseminate false information to disrupt voting. ""Legislators have perhaps over-calibrated on deceptive use of imagery depicting candidates,"" Lawson said.
Indeed, while the Biden robocall deepfake impersonated the president, the message wasn't designed to make Biden look bad by implicating him in a fake gaffe or scandal — rather, it was about discouraging voters from going out on election day. And this kind of risk isn't always covered by the new laws being introduced.
As we approach the general election this fall, we're entering a brave new world of potential threats to democracy. While the new laws are a good first step at addressing these threats, the election may uncover all the ways in which they fall short.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-03-28,Debate about safety of synthetic turf and 'forever chemicals' raises concerns for some,"Synthetic turf fields are made with ""forever chemicals"" perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, according to the EPA.","The grass may be greener if it's made of synthetic turf, but some communities are raising concerns about ""forever chemicals"" that may be found in many of the faux fields.
""Think about the wisdom of putting down acres of plastic in the year 2024... and then allowing athletes to go play on that for hours a week,"" Dr. Kyla Bennett, director of science policy for advocacy group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), told ABC News.
""To me, it doesn't pass the straight-face test,"" she said.
A number of synthetic turf fields in use today are believed to be made with plastic that may contain chemical substances perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl, known as PFAS, according to advocates and industry specialists. However, the percentage of synthetic turf fields made with these chemicals already installed or being manufactured for the future is unknown.
In this Aug. 2, 2023, file photo, a contractor works to replace artificial turf at Newton South High School in Newton, Mass. Environmentalists are upset about ""improper"" removal and health/climate impacts.

PFAS are a class of over 12,000 manufactured chemicals that have been used in industry and consumer products since the 1940s, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. They are known as ""forever chemicals,"" because they break down very slowly.
In a June 2023 letter, Synthetic Turf Council president and CEO Melanie Taylor said the industry needed until 2026 – ""in line with other PFAS legislation currently pending"" to ""develop viable alternatives for the marketplace"" without PFAS chemicals.
""We are concerned that trace quantities of a chemical may be present in natural or synthetic ingredients, recycled content, manufacturing processes or equipment,"" Taylor said.

In addition to synthetic turf, PFAS can be found in drinking water, food, cleaners, textiles, paper, paints, fire-fighting foams, wire insulation and more, according to the EPA, which notes some of these chemical compounds can accumulate and stay in the human body for long periods of time.
Many industries are attempting to remove PFAS from their products. In February, the FDA announced that after a four-year commitment, food packaging in the U.S. no longer includes PFAS for grease proofing, ""This means the major source of dietary exposure to PFAS from food packaging like fast-food wrappers, microwave popcorn bags, take-out paperboard containers and pet food bags is being eliminated.""
The health risks of forever chemical accumulation in the body are still uncertain and could include a higher risk of cancer, liver damage, fertility issues or asthma, according to the EPA.
In this Nov. 12, 2023, file photo, kids practicebaseball on an artificial turf field at the 4S Ranch Sports Park in San Diego, Calif.

However, there are known risks associated with ingestion or inhalation — It's not clear if there are significant health risks from touching them.
Some communities are concerned amid the uncertainty.
""Parents should not have to have a Ph.D. in analytical chemistry, to send their kids out to play on what they presumed to be a safe field,"" Dianne Woelke, a board member for Safe Healthy Playing Fields, Inc., an all-volunteer advocacy group, told ABC News.
""They assume that these chemicals have been proven to be safe, and they absolutely have not,"" she claimed.
In 2016, the EPA launched an investigation into the chemicals found in recycled tire crumb, a component of some synthetic turf and what, if any, human exposure might occur during contact with turf fields. The results of this investigation are still pending, but regardless of their findings, the agency states that its report should not be interpreted as a risk assessment and cannot determine levels above which health effects could occur.
PFAS chemicals are widely used to help with the molding and extrusions of plastic, which is often seen in synthetic turf, according to the Journal of Vinyl and Additive Technology.
Hailed by some proponents as the antidote to the effects of climate change, synthetic turf offers what is believed to be a no-water-necessary, durable and fertilizer-free option for athletic fields at every level.
In this 1966 file photo, astroturf is being installed at the Astrodome in Houston.

Synthetic turf was first installed in a major sporting venue at Houston's Astrodome in 1966. More than 50 years and several variations of synthetic turf later, thousands of recreational and professional-level fields across the country removed natural grass in favor of synthetic turf.
""Communities, schools, businesses and families across the country are choosing synthetic turf because of the significant benefits it offers, being accessible year-round, being more affordable to maintain, and protecting the environment through reduced water and chemical use,"" Synthetic Turf Council president Melanie Taylor told ABC News in a statement. ""The synthetic turf industry is proud to deliver quality products that make a positive difference and are used by thousands of communities nationwide.""
According to the Synthetic Turf Council, there are between 12,000 and 13,000 synthetic turf sports fields in the United States, with approximately 1,200 to 1,500 new installations each year.
Peter Wierzba, design specialist for synthetic turf manufacturing company Tough Turtle Turf, told ABC News synthetic turf ""just makes sense"" for multi-use sports fields that see constant, year-round activity.
""With natural grass, you get spotty fields, you get a lot of divots, you get a lot of gopher issues,"" Wierzba said. ""And those can be very, very harmful for injuries, ankles, knees and things of that sort.""

When asked about the concerns of PFAS in synthetic turf, Wierzba claimed there are no added PFAS in Tough Turtle Turf's fields and that maintaining natural grass fields includes its own host of dangerous chemical substances, as well.
""Synthetic turf reduces the use of pesticides, fertilizers, and gas and oil from lawn equipment,"" Wierzba said.

However, according to Bennett, with the advocacy group PEER, the potential risks do not outweigh the benefits of artificial turf, in her opinion. ""There's no doubt in my mind that the dangers of artificial turf outweigh any potential benefits,"" Bennett said.
Bennett said she and her colleagues at PEER conducted a small experiment with three middle school-aged soccer players and one soccer coach in Southern California to test if there would be an increase in PFOS -- a PFAS compound -- levels on their hands after playing on artificial turf versus grass.
The experiment was not peer-reviewed, meaning it did not go through a robust independent scientific review process and did not measure health risks.
""There are three pathways of PFOS exposure for artificial turf: ingestion, inhalation and dermal absorption,"" Bennett said. ""We just wanted to see whether or not they were actually getting PFOS on their skin from playing on the turf. And the answer is yes.""
""This preliminary study showed a need for further research to find out precisely how much PFAS these athletes are picking up and whether they're absorbing them into their bloodstream and what damage it's doing,"" Bennett said.

Salar Parvini, the soccer coach included in the study, questions whether possible the health risks surrounding synthetic turf will ever result in physical changes to the sports landscape.
""The whole grass versus artificial turf argument has been argued for over a decade, and the amount of turf only increases every year,"" Parvini told ABC News. ""You can't put the genie back in the bottle there.""

This month, the Philadelphia Inquirer released a yearlong investigation raising questions about whether forever chemical exposure could be linked to a spate of rare brain cancer deaths among six former Phillies baseball players.
""The rate of brain cancer among Phillies who played at the Vet between 1971 and 2003 was about three times higher than the average rate among adult men in the United States,"" the publication wrote on March 12.
However, cancer epidemiologists say the causes of cancer are often myriad and complex, making it difficult to link any one person's cancer to any one chemical in the environment. Further, the fact that nearly all Americans already have detectable levels of PFAS in their blood, according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), makes it more difficult to identify where someone may have been exposed.
The Phillies told the publication they consulted brain cancer experts who told the team there is no connection between turf, PFAS, and brain cancer.
However, as the science continues, state and local governments are taking steps to limit potential exposure.
In October 2023, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that allows local governments to ban synthetic grass in residential areas, however, that does not extend to recreational sports fields.
In September 2022, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ordered no new artificial turf to be installed in city parks.
The synthetic turf market is forecast to reach $7 billion by 2025, according to IndustryARC.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-03-28,"AI could eliminate nearly 8 million jobs in UK, study shows","AI could herald a ""job apocalypse,"" the study said.","Artificial intelligence could eliminate up to nearly 8 million jobs in the United Kingdom, according to a new study, which cautions that women and early-career employees are most at risk of being put out of work.
Government policy, however, could allow the U.K. to avert job losses and harness AI for a breakneck economic surge, according to the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research, the think tank that authored the report.
“The world of knowledge work will be transformed by generative AI,” the report said, referring to a type of AI that can create content, such as text or images. “We need to start preparing for this now.”
MORE: Is AI coming for your job? ChatGPT renews fears
Researchers analyzed 22,000 tasks carried out by workers across the U.K. economy, finding that 11% are currently exposed to the threat of displacement by AI, the study said. The jobs at greatest risk include entry-level, part-time and administrative roles -- a set of positions disproportionately held by women, the study added.
The report describes a soon-to-begin phase of AI adoption during which some of these “low-hanging fruit” jobs will be replaced by the technology. The overall workforce impact over the period could be limited, the study said, but some roles will experience massive effects, such as the elimination of one-third of administrative jobs.
A second phase could bring much deeper integration of AI that will threaten up to 59% of tasks, the report said. If companies allow AI to access proprietary information and execute key tasks, the study said, the resulting disruption may slash a wider swathe of jobs, including a larger share of high-paying positions.
While offering up potential outcomes, the study acknowledged that a wide range of job-displacement scenarios remains possible, including the potential for job losses to be avoided entirely.
Experts who spoke to ABC News last year noted the absence of job losses during a surge of AI adoption over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.

While data on the scale of displacement remains limited, the experts said, anecdotes confirm that the technology eliminates some positions while creating others.
The increased sophistication and use of AI is expected to displace jobs over the coming years, the experts added. AI will enhance productivity and increase compensation for some jobs but it risks leaving out workers who fail to keep up, they said.
Artificial intelligence could displace roughly 15% of workers, or 400 million people, worldwide between 2016 and 2030, according to a McKinsey study released in 2018. In a scenario of wide AI adoption, the share of jobs displaced could rise to as much as 30%, the firm found.
MORE: Dispute over threat of extinction posed by artificial intelligence looms over surging industry
The report out on Tuesday presented policy proposals that the authors believe could reduce the likelihood of job losses and heighten the possibility of an AI-induced economic boom.
A policy described by the report as “ringfencing,” for example, would mandate the continued use of human involvement for certain tasks, such as medical diagnoses. A combination of government incentives and public-private partnerships could help achieve the measure.
In its most optimistic potential scenario, the report outlines a future of AI adoption in which no jobs are lost and gross domestic product increases by 13%.
“There is no one predetermined path for how AI implementation will play out,” the report's authors said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

2024-03-27,RFK Jr. names lawyer Nicole Shanahan as his running mate,The independent candidate announced his choice at an event in Oakland.,"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Tuesday chose lawyer Nicole Shanahan as his running mate, lauding her stances and past work on issues like health outcomes for children and artificial intelligence and vowing the pair will give ""another choice"" to the swath of voters disenchanted with a Donald Trump-Joe Biden rematch.
Speaking to cheering supporters inside the vast auditorium of an Oakland convention center, Kennedy spent several minutes teasing his choice, speaking about Shanahan without naming her.
""I wanted a vice president who shared my passion for wholesome, healthy foods, chemical-free; for regenerative agriculture; for good soils,"" the former environmental lawyer said. ""And I found exactly the right person.""
Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. waves on stage with Nicole Shanahan after announcing her as his running mate, during a campaign event, on March 26, 2024, in Oakland, Calif.
Eric Risberg/AP
""I want a partner with strong ideas about how to reverse those dire threats to democracy and to our freedoms. I managed to find a technologist at the forefront of AI,"" he continued, before listing some of Shanahan's work with artificial intelligence.
Kennedy said he had wanted an ""athlete"" (Shanahan is a surfer, he noted) and ""most importantly,"" someone who is ""a young person"" who could help drive out the supporters whom polls suggest like Kennedy the most: younger voters.
He said choosing a young running mate was crucial. Shanahan, a lawyer and tech entrepreneur in the Bay Area, is 38.
MORE: Who is Nicole Shanahan, RFK Jr.'s running mate?
""I am so proud to introduce to you the next vice president of the United States, my fellow lawyer, a brilliant scientist, technologist, a fierce warrior mom, Nicole Shanahan,"" Kennedy said.
In a video shown to the audience before she took the stage, Shanahan described growing up in poverty in Oakland before running through a string of professional accomplishments.
She then described the difficult experience of learning in 2020 that her 10-month-old daughter had autism.

Shanahan appeared to attribute the diagnosis to environmental causes, as she used the anecdote to discuss the factors she said cause chronic disease in children. (Kennedy has been criticized for falsely linking vaccines to autism.)

On stage, Shanahan said she began to support Kennedy after a friend encouraged her to listen to an interview with him.
""And then I listened to another one, and then another one, and I recognized that the person who I was seeing in these interviews was the exact opposite of the media slander of his character,"" she said.
Joseph Piazza, a 60-year-old attendee, told ABC News as he left that he thought Kennedy's choice of Shanahan was ""excellent in a lot of ways.""
She and Kennedy provide a ""great contrast in generation while sticking to their core values,"" he added.
Emery Barter, a 40-year-old musician, said he was ""optimistic"" about Shanahan.
""I think she speaks to a lot of really important issues,"" Barter told ABC News, expressing skepticism that the other rumored running mate choices would have been able to be ""quite as relevant-sounding.""
They would have been ""attention-grabbers,"" Barter said.
Kennedy's announcement follows a selection process in which he vetted an eclectic group of high-profile people, including New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers, former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura and television host Mike Rowe.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-03-26,"Amazon expands same-day delivery for prescription drugs to NYC, LA","The company will offer same-day delivery to New York City and the Los Angeles area, which will join several other cities where the option is already offered.","Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""

The fast food chain announced on its website that while ""serving quality food has always been our priority,"" effective this spring, the restaurant will ""shift from No Antibiotics Ever (NAE) to No Antibiotics Important To Human Medicine (NAIHM).""

The key distinction between NAE and NAIHM, as outlined by Chick-fil-A, is that the first ""means no antibiotics of any kind were used in raising the animal,"" while ""NAIHM restricts the use of those antibiotics that are important to human medicine and commonly used to treat people, and allows use of animal antibiotics only if the animal and those around it were to become sick.""
In the announcement, Chick-fil-A reiterated its dedication to high-quality chicken is rooted in three components: selectivity, high animal wellbeing standards, and evolving the brand's approach.

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.

2024-03-22,AI influencers explode on social media. Some are controlled by teens,AI-generated avatars offer new forms of expression but also pose risks.,"Agnes, a bespectacled 20-year-old poet, likes tarot cards and late-night philosophy debates. She has a crush on Finn, a 22-year-old farmer who knits in his free time. Finn's friend Jade, 22, also lives in the countryside, where she forages for mushrooms and bakes bread.
Jade, Finn and Agnes are influencers who frequently post selfies and life updates -- but none of them actually exist.
They are the creations of 1337, a company that designs and operates artificial intelligence-generated online influencers, sometimes selecting what to post based on advice from real-life teenagers.
The firm makes up one upstart in a burgeoning industry that harnesses AI to draw eyeballs and drive revenue in the lucrative business of social media. By 2035, the so-called ""digital human economy"" is projected to become a $125 billion market, according to a report from research firm Gartner.
Lil Miquela, an AI-generated influencer made by tech firm Brud, boasts 2.6 million followers on Instagram.

The onset of AI-generated accounts introduces new opportunities for expression on social media, but it also raises questions about the possible use of the influencers to manipulate followers or spread misinformation, Claire Leibowicz, head of the AI and media integrity program at the nonprofit Partnership on AI, told ABC News.
""This brings up fundamental questions of what it means to have human relationships,"" Leibowicz said.
1337, pronounced ""leet,"" refers to its AI-generated influencers as ""entities."" Currently, the company says it operates 50 entities, each designed to appeal to a different audience. The company said it plans to add another 50 to its roster in April.
The company begins designing a new entity by identifying a community of people with a specific interest or trait who may take an interest in the influencer, Jenny Dearing, the co-founder and CEO of 1337, told ABC News. Then, she added, the firm fills out the details.
""We think about everything from how they might live their lives, where they reside, what does their room look like, what are their hobbies,"" Dearing said.
The company says humans are involved at multiple points to moderate the creation process, including ongoing curation from people Dearing described as ""creators."" Each creator is paired with an entity, helping to filter out flawed AI images and select posts in keeping with a given entity's persona. Some of the creators are teenagers.
Sawyer Erch, a 16-year-old who lives in Oakland, California, said they spend 20 to 30 minutes each day working as a creator for 1337. Using an app, Erch assesses AI-generated images to be included in future posts.

First, they said they check for abnormalities. ""A lot of time, there'll be extra fingers or extra limbs,"" Erch said.
Next, they make sure a prospective post conforms to the entity's backstory and personality. ""If it's something completely different, then you obviously can't pick that,"" Erch added.
Synthetic influencers offer an opportunity for people of all ages to interact with AI in a low-stakes setting, Erch said.
""AI is going to become more and more prominent,"" Erch said. ""So I think it’s good for younger people and older people to play around with that.""
Some advocates, however, caution about the risks posed by AI-generated social media posts.
Synthetic fashion influencers seem benign but similar products could be used to deceive their audience on more consequential issues, said Leibowicz, of Partnership on AI.
""While it may seem fine for influencers to be saying that this new lip gloss is really meaningful, we don't want that same technology to be used to cast doubt on much more,"" Leibowicz said. ""I would argue there are more high-stakes use cases than lip gloss.""
Some of the original 1337 profiles are identified as being generated by an AI tool, but the company said future profiles may not have the same disclaimer. Creators will determine what to disclose about an entity, the company said.
TikTok requires users to label AI-generated content, according to the company's content guidelines. Meta -- the parent company of Instagram and Facebook -- said last month it would begin labeling images created by OpenAI, Midjourney and other AI products.

""I hope this is a big step forward in trying to make sure that people know what they're looking at, and they know where what they're looking at comes from,"" Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, said in an interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America.""
""As the difference between human and synthetic content gets blurred, people want to know where the boundary lies,"" Clegg said.
The labeling approach shows a degree of enforcement but may face limitations, Leibowicz said.
""There's a visceral appeal to putting a little mark on TikTok or a mark on Instagram that says, 'This is fake,'"" Leibowicz added. ""But whether or not people care, and whether that will be applied in a context that matters, is a big open question.""
No matter how it gets addressed, AI is here to stay, said M.B., Erch's mother.
""Pandora's box is open,"" she said. ""AI is not going back in the box.""

2024-03-20,Elon Musk releases code for his AI chatbot Grok. Here's why it matters,The move centers on a key issue in the fight to shape AI.,"Some of the world’s largest companies and richest people are fighting over a question that will help shape the future of AI: Should firms reveal exactly how their products work?
Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, upended the debate in recent days by opting to release the computer code behind his AI chatbot, Grok.
The move contrasts with the approach taken by OpenAI, the company behind popular AI text bot ChatGPT. OpenAI, part owned by tech giant Microsoft, opted to release comparatively few details about the latest algorithm behind its products.
Elon Musk did not respond to ABC News' request for comment. Neither did OpenAI.
In a statement earlier this month, OpenAI rebuked claims that the company has kept its AI models secret.
""We advance our mission by building widely-available beneficial tools. We’re making our technology broadly usable in ways that empower people and improve their daily lives, including via open-source contributions,"" the company said. ""We provide broad access to today's most powerful AI, including a free version that hundreds of millions of people use every day.""
Here’s what to know about Grok, why Elon Musk disclosed the computer code and what it means for the future of AI:
What is Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok?
Last year, Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, vowing to develop a generative AI program that competes with established offerings like ChatGPT.
MORE: Dispute over threat of extinction posed by artificial intelligence looms over surging industry
On several occasions, Musk has warned against risks of political bias in AI chatbots, which help shape public opinion and risk the spread of misinformation.
However, content moderation itself has become a polarizing topic and Musk has voiced opinions that place his approach within that hot-button political context, some experts previously told ABC News.
In November, xAI debuted an early version of its first product, Grok, which responds to user prompts with humorous comments modeled on the classic sci-fi novel ""Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.""
Grok is powered by Grok-1, a large language model that generates content based on statistical probabilities learned from scanning vast amounts of text.
To access Grok, users must first purchase a premium subscription to X, the social media platform owned by Musk.
""We believe that it is important to design AI tools that are useful to people of all backgrounds and political views. We also want to empower our users with our AI tools, subject to the law,"" xAI said in a blog post in November. ""Our goal with Grok is to explore and demonstrate this approach in public.""
Why did Musk make the code openly available?
The decision to release the code behind Grok touches on two issues important to Musk: The threat posed by AI and an ongoing battle with rival company OpenAI.
For years, Musk has warned that AI risks significant societal harm. In 2017, he tweeted: ""If you’re not concerned about AI safety, you should be.” And more recently, in March 2023, he signed onto an open letter warning of the “profound risks to society and humanity"" posed by AI.
In remarks on Sunday, Musk appeared to frame the open-source decision as a means of ensuring transparency, protecting against bias and minimizing the danger posed by Grok.
""Still work to do, but this platform is already by far the most transparent & truth-seeking,"" Musk said in a post on X.

The move also relates directly to a public feud between Musk and OpenAI.
Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but left the organization in 2018, sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman earlier this month, alleging the company abandoned its mission of benefiting humanity in a sprint toward profits.
Days after filing the lawsuit, Musk said on X that he would drop the case if OpenAI changed its name to ""ClosedAI.""
In a statement earlier this month, OpenAI said it plans to move to dismiss all of Musk's legal claims.
""As we discussed a for-profit structure in order to further the mission, Elon wanted us to merge with Tesla or he wanted full control. Elon left OpenAI, saying there needed to be a relevant competitor to Google/DeepMind and that he was going to do it himself. He said he’d be supportive of us finding our own path,"" OpenAI said.
What are the stakes of the fight over open vs. closed source AI?
The debate over whether to release the computer code behind AI products divides along two competing visions of how to limit harm, remove bias and optimize performance.
On the one hand, proponents of open source say that publicly available code allows a wide community of AI engineers to identify and fix flaws in a system, or tailor it for a purpose separate from its originally intended function.
In theory, the open-source code offers programmers an opportunity to improve the security of a given product while ensuring accountability by making everything visible to the public.

""Whenever somebody's creating a piece of software, there can be bugs that can be exploited in ways that can cause security vulnerabilities,"" Sauvik Das, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who focuses on AI and cybersecurity, told ABC News. ""It doesn't matter if you're the most brilliant programmer in the world.""
""If you open source, then you have an entire community of practitioners who poke holes and gradually over time build up patches and defenses,"" Das added.
By contrast, supporters of closed source argue that the best way to safeguard AI is to keep the computer code private so it stays out of the hands of bad actors, who might repurpose it for malicious ends.

Closed-source AI also affords a leg up to companies who may want to capitalize upon advanced products unavailable to the wider public.
""The closed-source systems are more difficult to redeploy for nefarious reasons simply because they already exist and there are only certain things you can do with them,"" Kristian Hammond, a professor of computer science at Northwestern University who studies AI, told ABC News.
Last month, the White House announced it was requesting public comment on the benefits and dangers of open-source AI systems. The move came as part of a sweeping set of AI rules issued by the Biden administration through executive order in October.
Das, of Carnegie Mellon, said the open-source release by Musk may be motivated by both public and personal interests but the move has sparked a much-needed conversation about this facet of AI safety.
""Even if the motives aren't necessarily totally pure, the fact that this is raising public consciousness around this idea of open versus closed -- and the benefits versus the risks of both -- is exactly what we need in society right now in order to raise public awareness,"" Das said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-03-19,Here's what you need to know about Biden's executive order on women's health research,"President Joe Biden signed an executive order on women's health research, to help focus on diseases and conditions that disproportionately affect women.","President Joe Biden signed a sweeping executive order Monday promoting women's health research as the country continues to celebrate Women's History Month.
The White House described it as the ""most comprehensive set of actions"" taken by a president to advance women's health research, which will focus on diseases and conditions that disproportionately affect women.
Biden has previously hinted to the initiative during his State of the Union address earlier this month, describing women's health as chronically underfunded and calling on Congress to approve $12 billion to support a women's health fund for the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Here are some of the women's health issues Biden said he wants to tackle in his executive order:
Research focusing on women's health after menopause
Biden's executive order will support research into women's midlife health and diseases that are prevalent after menopause, including heart disease and osteoporosis.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will be directed to increase data collection about women's midlife health and find ways to improve management of menopause-related issues.
After someone goes through menopause, their ovaries produce less estrogen, which increases the risk of developing certain health problems.

Heart disease is one of the most common health problems women face after menopause. Women have a lower risk of heart disease than men before age 55 because estrogen protects blood vessels and helps the body balance cholesterol levels.
Once a woman produces less estrogen, arteries can become thicker and stiffen, and ""bad"" cholesterol may build up on the walls of the arteries leading to heart disease.
By age 70, women have the same risk for heart disease as men of similar age, according to the HHS. They are also at increased risk of stroke.
Osteoporosis -- a bone disease caused by a loss of bone density and bone mass as well as structural changes to the bone -- is another risk facing postmenopausal women. Lower estrogen levels after menopause can speed up the loss of bone mass, increasing the risk of fractures.
It's unknown how many older women have osteoporosis in the U.S. but, using criteria from the World Health Organization (WHO), it is estimated about 30% of caucasian postmenopausal women have osteoporosis, according to the Johns Hopkins Arthritis Center.
Under the executive order, Biden also stated the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will evaluate the needs of women service members and veterans for midlife health issues, including menopausal symptoms.
More women in clinical trials
In the executive order, the president said members of the initiative would work to ""improve the recruitment, enrollment, and retention of women in clinical trials, including, as appropriate, by reducing barriers through technological and data sciences advances.""

As recently as the 1970s, few women were enrolled in clinical trials, and it was believed women's health needs were a low priority.
In 1986, the NIH establish a policy that encouraged the inclusion of women in studies, but the policy was poorly communicated and inconsistently applied. Eventually, Congress passed a law in 1993 that established guidelines for the inclusion of women and underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups in clinical research.
However, women are still underrepresented, particularly in the early stages of clinical trials. One 2022 study found women account for between 29% and 34% of early-stage clinical trials due to concerns about fertility. This can often lead to a lack of understanding about how women may respond to a new drug compared to men.
Another 2022 study from Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital found females make up 60% of all patients with psychiatric disorders, but just 42% of participants in clinical trials investigating drugs and devices to treat those disorders. Similar findings were seen with examined data from clinical trials for cardiovascular disease and cancer.
Conditions with different symptoms for men and women
During a press call on Sunday afternoon, Dr. Carolyn Mazure, chairperson of the White House Initiative on Women's Health Research, said the order will also focus on conditions that affect women disproportionately including Alzheimer's disease and rheumatoid arthritis.

Women have a greater lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer's disease than men, one reason being that women live longer than men, according to an article published in Harvard Health Publishing from Harvard Medical School.
However, it's not understood if there are any biomarkers or other unknown factors that make women more susceptible.
In the case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), women are up to three times more likely than men to be diagnosed with the condition. It is believed that several factors, including sex hormones, play a role, but researchers say more work needs to be done in understanding why women are more predisposed to developing RA and also why different joints are affected in women compared to men.

2024-03-16,Will Bernie Sanders' proposed 32-hour workweek pass Congress?,The measure would require companies to cut hours but preserve pay.,"A push to slash the standard workweek from 40 hours to 32 achieved a breakthrough this week, gaining a foothold in the Senate with a proposal that would require businesses to offer the 32-hour workweek but preserve employee pay.
The bill, put forward by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., drew praise from labor advocates who tout the benefits of the reduced hours not only for workers' wellbeing but for the productivity benefits enjoyed by their employers.
However, political analysts who spoke to ABC News cast doubt on the measure's chances of passage in a divided Congress where opposition from Republicans is all but certain and even the extent of support among Democrats remains unclear.
""It's so hard to get anything passed, especially when you have such high levels of polarization. It doesn't take a lot to stop legislation,"" Richard Hall, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, told ABC News.
""You'd have to imagine a very different political world than what we have now,"" Hall added.
MORE: Does a 4-day workweek work? Companies share results after 1 year
Proponents of the measure point to the output gains generated by workplace technology, including recent improvements in automation and artificial intelligence.
The standard 40-hour workweek became a federal requirement in 1940, when rudimentary machinery made for diminished worker productivity. Today, much more output can be achieved in fewer hours, advocates say.
A study out of the United Kingdom last month found nearly 9 in 10 companies opted to retain a four-day workweek after participating in a temporary pilot program.
Support for the measure in Congress, however, remains scant. The proposal made by Sanders on Wednesday carries the support of just two other lawmakers, California Democrats Sen. Laphonza Butler and Rep. Mark Takano.
""I don't see this current iteration of the law getting through Congress,"" Lynne Vincent, a professor of industrial and labor relations at Syracuse University, told ABC News.
A near-identical bill proposed by Takano in the House last year gained the support of just seven colleagues in that chamber.
Some Republican lawmakers voiced opposition to the newly announced measure in a hearing of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on Thursday.
The proposal amounts to an effective pay increase forced upon businesses, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said, predicting that the 32-hour workweek would ""destroy some employers.""
""They would ship those jobs overseas or they would automate to replace those workers for whom they have an increased expense, or they would dramatically increase prices to stay afloat,"" Cassidy added.

Sen. Mike Braun, R-In., said a 32-hour workweek could be appropriate as a voluntary policy adopted by some large businesses, but he expressed strong opposition to a federal requirement.
""I disagree with trying to do anything from this place that would impose upon the preponderance of businesses out there where I just don't think they could survive,"" Braun said.
The push for a shortened workweek has gained momentum in recent years, driven in part by the rise of employee flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Spain, Iceland and South Africa are among the nations that have implemented a trial of the four-day workweek for select companies and workers.
Belgium enacted a law in 2022 that requires employers to offer full-time workers a right to request a four-day workweek.
At the state level, lawmakers in Massachusetts introduced a bill last year that would provide employers with a tax credit if they shift at least 15 workers to four days a week without cutting their pay.
In California, lawmakers have introduced a bill that would set the standard workweek at 32 hours.

""Reducing the number of working days is not a new idea,"" Vincent said. ""We have evidence from different sectors and countries that this can work.""
Still, Vincent added, the measure stands little chance of passage under the current Congress. ""Whenever there's anything related to a large change, it's going to meet a lot of resistance,"" Vincent said.
For the bill to reach President Joe Biden's desk, it would need to garner majority support in the Republican-controlled House as well as a filibuster-proof 60 vote approval in the Senate. If the measure were to reach Biden, it remains unclear whether he would sign it.
""It will never get through Congress -- not in my lifetime,"" Tracy Roof, a professor of political science at the University of Richmond who focuses on labor issues, told ABC News. ""Maybe it will happen in my children's lifetimes.""

2024-03-15,Kate Middleton photo fallout: News agency says palace is no longer trusted source,Princess Kate was forced to issue an apology over an edited family photo.,"Kensington Palace is no longer considered a trusted source, according to one global news agency, after a photo of Kate, the Princess of Wales, and her children was retracted due to editing concerns.
Phil Chetwynd, global news director at Agence France-Presse, told BBC Radio on Thursday that news agencies around the world called a meeting to address the issue once they realized a photo the palace shared on X on Sunday ""clearly violated"" their rules, leading them to issue a ""kill notice"" to publishers around the world.
According to Chetwynd, issuing a ""kill notice"" for a photograph based on manipulation is a very rare occurrence.
When asked by BBC Radio if the palace would still be trusted as a source, Chetwynd answered no.
""No, absolutely not,"" he said. ""Like with anything, when you're let down by a source, the bar is raised.""
He continued, ""And we've got, you know, major issues internally as to how we validate that photo. We shouldn't have done it. It violated our guidelines and, therefore, you know, we sent out notes to all our team at the moment to be absolutely super more vigilant about the content coming across our desk, even from what we would call trusted sources.""
The photo editing controversy involving Kate is one that has left the public questioning the reliability of the royal family.

In addition to the photo controversy, since the start of the new year, Britain's royal family has faced a cancer diagnosis for its 75-year-old monarch, a publicly unexpected surgery and hospitalization for Kate, one of its most popular members.
The two health crises -- King Charles III's diagnosis of an undisclosed type of cancer and Kate's ""planned abdominal surgery"" in January -- have left the family without two of its most high-profile members to carry on royal engagements and be the faces of the monarchy.
The complete absence of Kate, who is married to Prince William, from the public eye since late December, in particular, has led to a swirl of conspiracy theories online ranging from a secret pregnancy or divorce to physical or mental health breakdowns.
When William and Kate presumably tried to quiet the storm of online theories by releasing a photo on Mother's Day in the U.K. of a smiling Kate surrounded by the couple's three children -- Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte -- the effort backfired completely.
After the photo -- taken by William -- was retracted by several global news agencies over concerns it was ""manipulated,"" Kate issued a public apology, a very rare step for a royal.
""Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing,"" Kate said in the apology, shared on X, and signed with her initial ""C,"" for Catherine. ""I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother's Day.""
Unfortunately for the royal family, the apology seemed to make matters worse, with even more theories erupting online about whether it was really Kate who edited the photo, why she took the blame, and what other photographs shared by the royals have also been heavily edited.
""The reality is, now the conspiracy theories have gone into overdrive,"" said Robert Jobson, an ABC News royal contributor. ""It's clearly proved that all that they've been saying is true. 'Where is Kate? Is this really a photograph at all? If they can mess around with Charlotte's hand, well, how do we know it's even Kate's face?'""
He continued, ""If the intention of Kensington Palace was to dampen down all this mad speculation online, well, it hasn't worked.""
Most royal experts and visual verification experts alike seem to agree that the editing in Kate's Mother's Day photo seems minor, likely nothing more than an effort by a mom to make herself and her kids look as good as possible.

Hany Farid, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told ABC News his analysis of the photo shows ""minor manipulation,"" and no evidence it is an AI-generated photo.
""I think most likely it is either some bad photoshop to, for example, remove a stain on the sweater, or is the result of on-camera photo compositing that combines multiple photos together to get a photo where everyone is smiling,"" Farid said. ""Either way, I think it is unlikely that this is anything more than a relatively minor photo manipulation.""

But questions remain about how and why the palace got this wrong, and why they are remaining silent in the face of such controversy.
""The palace has got this 100% wrong,"" Jobson said, adding that he would urge Kensington Palace to release the original, unedited photo. ""Put out the original photograph, because if you put out the original photograph, which has got maybe Kate looking in the wrong direction, or Charlotte not paying attention or Louis not smiling, it doesn't matter.""
Jobson said the photo editing error by William and Kate is not the first for the royal family. He recalled that in 1999, royal officials released a photo from the wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie, the Duchess of Edinburgh, in which William's face had been transposed with a photo that showed him smiling.
""Clearly this has been going on for some time,"" Jobson said. ""But in this day of artificial intelligence, in this day that we the public have really got to trust and rely upon organizations to put out honest and faithful photographs and honest and faithful information if they don't, then that trust is eroded, unfortunately.""
Victoria Murphy, also an ABC News royal contributor, described Kate's photo controversy as an unforced error by the palace.
""Editing the image in any way was a particularly silly mistake because this is a time of all times when the palace should have known that people would be heavily scrutinizing it,"" she said. ""Even though I don't think it's the case that the royals intended to hide anything major with these edits, just the fact the picture was edited has led to more conspiracy theories as well as wider public interest debates about trust from public bodies and concerns over fake news.""
Contrary to the idea of a big, formal press operation managing the monarchy, the press team for William and Kate is what Murphy described as a ""small and close-knit team."" She said it was that team, led by William and Kate's press secretaries, that would have led the response to the photo controversy, as well as, in the weeks prior, responded to the growing questions about Kate's well-being.
Jobson echoed that point, noting that it was William and Kate and their team, not other palace officials, who decided to use a photo taken by William, rather than a professional photographer.

Jobson placed the blame for this latest royal controversy on the Kensington Palace communications team, noting that anything the royal family does is ""historic"" and a mistake like this is ""pretty damning for history.""
""I think the most important thing here is, really, that it's not Kate that's done anything wrong. It's not William that's done anything wrong,"" Jobson said. ""They pay a lot of money for professionals to run the communications team, and ultimately they should have had the strength of character to turn and say, 'We cannot put that out because if we do, people are going to start asking questions, not about our integrity of our photographs, but if you put out a fake photograph, how can they believe the information that we are also putting out and releasing about private events?'""
He continued, ""It's all about integrity, and integrity is crucial when you're dealing with a serious situation like this where you're representing members of the royal family.""
A 'depleted' monarchy
The controversy swirling around Kate has put a spotlight not only on the palace, but also on the monarchy itself.
When Charles became king in 2022, after the death of Queen Elizabeth II, criticism about the monarchy's link to colonialism and waning support among young people, according to a YouGov poll, reignited questions about the future of the monarchy and its purpose in modern times.
As those questions continue, the monarchy is trying to move forward without two of its most public figures, and without as many options as in previous years of other royal family members to step in.
Kate's last public appearance was on Christmas Day, and she is not expected to resume public duties until at least after Easter, according to Kensington Palace. William also took time off from public duties to care for Kate earlier this year.

He is now back to work but earlier this month missed a royal engagement due to a ""personal matter,"" which further set off speculation.
Charles, who has not commented publicly on Kate's health or the photo editing controversy, has stepped back from public duties since his cancer diagnosis was revealed in early February.

2024-03-13,Scientists are using underwater speakers to help restore degraded coral reefs: Study,"Researchers have discovered a new method that could encourage the restoration of degraded coral reef populations, which have been declining around the world.","Researchers have discovered a new method that could encourage the restoration of degraded coral reef populations, which have been declining around the world due to record-high marine temperatures.
The sounds of a healthy reef could be used to encourage coral larvae to recolonize damaged or degraded reefs, according to a study published in the journal Royal Society Open Science on Tuesday. Underwater speakers that play the sounds of a healthy reef, such as fish calls, were found to help coral larvae settle at rates up to seven times higher.
Acoustic enrichment can be a key intervention to support imperiled reefs. Using an underwater speaker system, researchers found that broadcasting the soundscape of a healthy reef at a degraded reef caused coral larvae to settle at significantly higher rates.
Dan Mele, ©Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
Researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution have been recording underwater sounds from coral reefs in the Caribbean for close to a decade, Nadège Aoki, a marine biologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts and author of the paper, told ABC News. During that time, they observed that healthier reefs tended to have more diverse fish assemblages as well as more complex soundscapes.
Fish make sounds by strumming on their swim bladder and crunching and scraping on corals, Aoki said. Other sounds of the reef could include the crackling of snapping shrimp, according to the researchers.
""They have a sound environment that is distinctive and gives kind of an acoustic signature to the reef,"" Aoki said.

In their first days of life, coral larvae make a permanent decision of where they will settle and metamorphose into adults -- swimming or drifting with the currents in an effort to seek the right conditions to settle. The sounds of the reef are important settlement cues, the paper found.
Corals are immobile as adults, so the larval stage is their only opportunity to select a good habitat.
A reef that has been degraded, whether by coral bleaching, disease, or direct human impacts, can’t support the same diversity of species and has a much quieter, less rich soundscape. A new paper from researchers at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution shows that sound could potentially be a vital tool in the effort to restore coral reefs.
Dan Mele, ©Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
The researchers collected larvae from adult colonies of the mustard hill coral species off the coast of the U.S. Virgin Islands and re-placed them on three reefs along the southern coast of St. John -- one of which was healthy and the other two labeled as relatively degraded, with sparse coral and few fish.
The larvae were placed on the reefs' little cups in order to create a controlled environment at distances of one, five, 10 and 30 meters from the solar-powered speakers, which played the sounds of a healthy reef recorded about 10 years earlier, according to the paper.

After collecting the cups, the researchers found that the larvae that were placed near underwater speakers settled at a rate of about twice as much, Aoki said.
""This effect decreased as you got farther away from the speaker,"" she added. ""Low-frequency sound appears to have an impact on their settlement behavior as well.""

The experiment, sponsored by the Vere and Oceankind Foundations and the National Science Foundation, was conducted twice in the summer of 2022.
The oval-shaped larvae, about the size of a grain of rice, are covered in ciliary hairs, leading the scientists to believe they are sensing the sound waves through the epidermis, Aoki said, adding that the exact mechanism in which the corals are potentially hearing by is not yet known.

The researchers embarked on the study in response to the ""alarming"" rates at which coral reefs are declining, Aoki said. The results of the study suggests that acoustic enrichment could be a new method to restore coral reefs, the researcher said.
Aoki believes that the method can be used in nurseries both on land and off the coast to restore coral reef populations. In addition, underwater speakers have the ability to broadcast to a large area, she said.

Reef populations off the coast of Florida and in the Caribbean experienced a large bleaching event over the summer due to record-breaking marine heatwaves. Reef populations will need all the help they can get to recover from climate change-induced stressors, Aoki said.
""We're observing thermal heating and bleaching events happening at more regular frequencies than they have in the past, and that makes it very difficult for reefs to have sufficient time to recover and grow back in between these disruptive events,"" she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

""Not only is that going to feed doubts amongst our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, it's going to stoke the ambition, so the Chinese leadership in contingencies ranging from Taiwan to the South China Sea,"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(END VIDEO CLIP)
ANNOUNCER: From ABC News, it’s THIS WEEK. Here now, George Stephanopoulos.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Good morning and welcome to THIS WEEK.
It's the first rematch between a president and the president he defeated in more than a century. And it's a rematch that few voters seem to want.
Our new ABC News/IPSOS poll shows the majority of Americans have unfavorable impressions of both candidates and a three-way tie on who Americans trust to do a better job leading the U.S., with 30 percent saying neither.
Biden and Trump held dueling rallies in the battleground state of Georgia on Saturday. That’s where we begin with senior White House correspondent Selina Wang.
Good morning, Selina.
SELINA WANG, ABC NEWS SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Hey, George, good morning to you.
That's right, we may be eight months away from election day, but those dueling rallies held here last night shows we're already barreling towards the general election. That Biden/Trump rematch has officially kicked off.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
CROWD: Let’s go Joe! Let’s go Joe!
WANG (voice over): In Georgia last night, President Biden and Donald Trump going head to head.
DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Hello, Georgia.
WANG (voice over): Both Biden and Trump now focusing their campaigns on November.
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our freedoms are literally on the ballot this November. Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans are trying to take our freedoms away.
But guess what? We're not going to let them take them away.
TRUMP: But if you’re a disillusioned Democrat, of which there are many today, I extend an open hand, an open invitation, and I ask you to join us on the noble quest of saving our country.
WANG (voice over): Trump, who's days away from becoming the GOP nominee for the third time, rallying in a state where he faces criminal charges for his alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which he denies.
Trump, once again, made false claims about the 2020 election and repeated his attacks on E. Jean Carroll, despite a jury's more than $83 million defamation verdict against him.
But that didn't bother the voters we spoke to in Rome, Georgia, part of the conservative district of Marjorie Taylor Greene.
WANG: And would you still support Trump if he were convicted of a crime?
DANIEL LATHAM, GEORGIA VOTER: I would. I would say that it would depend on the crime and the validity of the crime.
WANG (voice over): Some 70 miles away in Atlanta, Biden repeating his warning that Trump is a threat to democracy.
BIDEN: When he says he wants to be a dictator, I believe him.
WANG (voice over): The president looking to build off of any momentum from his State of the Union Address.
BIDEN: My purpose tonight is to wake up the Congress and alert the American people that this is no ordinary moment either.
WANG (voice over): Voters we spoke to split on if that performance was enough.
WANG: Did his speech ease any of your concerns around age?
JAYNE KOVICH, PENNSYLVANIA VOTER: Last night, yes, I would say it did, because he didn't seem -- he seemed like he was focusing on the teleprompters. He didn't stray off and lose his thoughts.
EUGENE LOPE, PENNSYLVANIA VOTER: I think he put up an act. You know, he's trying to show everybody he's capable. He's not capable. That's the thing.
WANG (voice over): While the president addressed his age on Thursday night --
BIDEN: I know it may not look like it, but I’ve been around a while.
WANG (voice over): The Biden campaign now further trying to alleviate concerns that the president's age is a liability, instead pitching it as an advantage in a new $30 million ad blitz.
BIDEN: Look, I'm not a young guy. That's no secret. But here's the deal, I understand how to get things done for the American people.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
WANG: Last night’s split screen proves just how critical this state will be. Back in 2020, Biden only beat Trump by a margin of less than 12,000 votes.
Now, look, the Biden campaign tells me they know how close this race is going to be. The president, after his travels to Pennsylvania and here in Georgia, he’s heading to Wisconsin and Michigan this week. The president ramping up the fight in those key battleground states.
George.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Selina Wang, thanks.
We’re joined now by former presidential candidate, current transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg.
Mr. Secretary, thanks for joining us this morning.
You know, the president got good reviews for his State of the Union, but our new poll shows that Donald Trump has the edge on critical issues like the economy, inflation and crime. How do you explain that? How do you turn it around?
PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: Well, I’m one of those who believes that President Biden deserves more credit for the historic economic results that he’s delivered, record job creation, unemployment that hasn’t stayed this low for this long since before I was born.
Even -- you know, most of us don’t think that the stock market is an indicator of the economy, but if you do, because I know the former president does, hit an all-time high under President Biden and not under President Trump.
But also, credit doesn’t accrue unless you go out and take credit and explain how these things were achieved. That’s one of the reasons why I’m so energized by the president’s State of the Union Address where he talked about the achievements that had -- that had come about on his watch and why, and then just as importantly, talk about the future.
He didn’t just talk about how he made sure that seniors only pay $35 a month for insulin, he reminded America that we could have that for all Americans, that’s part of his second term agenda and actually something we could have today if just a handful of congressional Republicans would change course and stand with us instead of with big pharma.
So, on issue after issue after issue, Americans agree with President Biden. But, of course, it requires work to get that story out, especially when there’s a fire hose of negativity, talking down the economy and trying to change the subject from the president’s achievements, which is just politics. But it’s exactly why it’s so important to tell the story right now.
STEPHANOPOULOS: The Republican response came from Senator Katie Britt of Alabama. Let’s take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. KATIE BRITT (R-AL): The free world deserves better than a dithering and diminished leader. Just ask yourself, are you better off now than you were three years ago?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, majority of Americans are saying the answer to that is no. That’s a classic Ronald Reagan question.
BUTTIGIEG: Yeah. Three or four years you couldn’t get toilet paper. Three or four years ago we were in the middle of a pandemic that killed about a million people. When we took office, just to take a couple examples from the transportation sector, there had been four straight years of promises about an infrastructure build that never came. Of course, President Biden delivered that in his first year and is contributing to manufacturing jobs and construction jobs around the country. Aviation right now, one of our biggest challenges in making sure airplanes can keep up with the demand. Three years ago the big question was whether America’s airlines were going to go out of business because of the condition that the economy was in when President Biden inherited it.
Now, I know those response addresses have to be written before the State of the Union is actually delivered, and I don’t think they usually change them because on what actually happens during the address, but anybody who watched that address saw not just in the substance but in the delivery of President Biden’s remarks, a leader who is in command, showing strength and clarity of vision.
STEPHANOPOULOS: But how can an 81-year-old incumbent be the candidate of change? It’s so critical in presidential elections.
BUTTIGIEG: Well, look at the changes that he’s brought about. Take some of the issues that matter most to newer generations. Climate is a great example, right? He, I think, generously suggested that nobody in the chamber would disagree with him that climate change is real and a real problem, and yet I could hear snickering from behind me from some congressional Republicans who were saying they don’t think it is a problem.
So, it’s a good example of that saying that what matters most is the age of a leader’s ideas. And, you know, similarly, as you look at some of the issues that are especially important to younger generations, like LGBTQ equality, I appreciated that he renewed the call for the Equality Act.
And then, of course, the issue which I think affects all generations of choice. Look, the last president, President Trump, kept his promise to end the freedom to choose in America. That’s one of the few promises that he did keep as a consequence, not only access to abortion but access to IVF is now being interrupted in the United States of America. President Biden laid out a very clear vision, called on Congress to restore the right to Roe v. Wade, something he’s very focused on doing.
STEPHANOPOULOS: In her speech, Britt also falsely implied that the violence encounter by a sex-trafficking victim she met with was the fault of Biden administration policies. In fact, the crimes occurred in Mexico during the George W. Bush administration. That’s not stopping the senator from standing by the story.
What do you make of that? And with Congress paralyzed, what more can President Biden do on his own to secure the border?
BUTTIGIEG: I’ll leave it to her to explain the falsehoods, but I think it illustrates the bigger issue. She’s a United States senator and the United States Senate right now could be acting to help secure the southern border.
As a matter of fact, they very nearly did with negotiations that included very conservative Republicans and Democrats, and had support from the White House, reaching a package that, frankly, involved tough compromises for all sides, something that the basis of both parties might not have loved, but would have made a real positive difference -- only for that to be killed by the chill effect that the former president put on congressional Republicans, telling ‘em not to support anything that would represent a policy win for President Biden.
Look, we have a very clear choice between congressional Republicans who seemed to prefer that this issue remained bad so that they can attack the president over it and those who would actually live to solve it or at least improve it and address it. I think that’s the most important question that should be raised.
And you mentioned that, you know, the story that it was suggested to be a reflection on President Biden turns out to have dated from the Bush administration and happened in a different country. One thing that gets me thinking about is since the beginning of the Bush administration, there had been three major bipartisan attempts to have comprehensive immigration reform or do something big and meaningful about the border. I think 2006, 2013 and now 2024.
Will 2024 go down in history as yet another failed attempt at bipartisan compromise or will congressional Republicans follow the lead of their own negotiators and the president of the United States and actually do something about it?
STEPHANOPOULOS: Donald Trump is taunting the president about debates. Do you think we’re going to see them this year?
BUTTIGIEG: Look, I can’t speak to the campaign side while I’m here as secretary. What I will say is that we got a great story to tell as an administration, and just as you see the president hitting the road to tell that story, I know the cabinet will as well. And we’re proud of it. I mean, no modern president has been able to deliver this kind of job growth, this kind of low unemployment, this kind of infrastructure delivery. It hasn’t happened since Eisenhower.
But again, look, the nature of our world and certainly the nature of today’s media environment is people aren’t just going to go hand the credit to the president. We need to be out there, illustrating why this happened. And most importantly, making clear what this administration’s agenda for the future is.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Secretary Buttigieg, thanks for your time this morning.
BUTTIGIEG: Thank you.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Our next guest is South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace, a Donald Trump supporter who gave candid and courageous testimony about her own experience as a rape victim weeks before launching her run for Congress in 2019.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC): From some of us who've been raped, it can take 25 years to get up the courage and talk about being a victim of rape. And the first thing that happens when a woman comes out in public and says she's been raped, what is the first thing out of someone's mouth? Is that it didn't happen. This is why women do not come forward. They are afraid.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
STEPHANOPOULOS: Congresswoman, thanks for joining us this morning.
You endorsed Donald Trump for president. Judges in two separate juries have found him liable for rape and for defaming a victim of that rape. How do you square your endorsement of Donald Trump with the testimony we just saw?
MACE: Well, I will tell you, I was raped at the age of 16, and any rape victim will tell you, I’ve lived for 30 years with an incredible amount of shame over being raped. I didn't come forward because of that judgment and shame that I felt.
And it's a shame that you will never feel, George, and I’m not going to sit here on your show and be asked a question meant to shame me about another potential rape victim. I’m not going to do that.
STEPHANOPOULOS: It's actually not about shaming you. It’s a question about Donald Trump.
MACE: No, you are shaming me.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You've endorsed Donald Trump for president.
MACE: Right.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Donald Trump has been found liable for rape by a jury. Donald Trump has been found liable for defaming the victim of that rape by a jury. It's been affirmed by a judge. He repeated --
MACE: It’s not a criminal court case, number one. Number two, I live with shame, and you're asking me a question about my political choices trying to shame me as a rape victim and find it disgusting.
And quite frankly, E. Jean Carroll's comments when she did get the judgment joking about what she was going to buy, it doesn't -- it makes it harder for women to come forward when they make a mockery out of rape, when they joke about it. It’s not OK.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Doesn't it make it harder for women to come forward when they're defamed by presidential candidates?
MACE: It makes it harder when other women joked about it and she’s joked about it. I find it offensive. And also I find it offensive that you are trying to shame me with this question.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I’m not trying to shame you at all. In fact --
MACE: You are. I have dealt with this for 30 years. You know how hard it was to tell my story five years ago when they were doing a fetal heartbeat bill, when there were no exceptions for rape, incest or life – or – and – rape or incest in there? I had to tell my story because no other woman was coming forward.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm just asking –
MACE: No rape victims were represented. And you’re trying to shame me this morning.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm just asking you –
MACE: And I find it offensive. And this is why women won’t come forward.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Women won’t come forward because they're defamed by those who perpetrate rape. Donald Trump has been –
MACE: They are judged, and they’re shamed, and you’re trying to shame me this morning. I think it’s disgusting.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm – I'm not – I'm not shaming you at all. I called you courageous.
MACE: I told my story. It took me 25 years to tell my story. I was judged for it. I still get judged for it today.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm asking you a very simple question, explain what –
MACE: And I answered it. You're shaming me for my political choices.
STEPHANOPOULOS: No, I'm not -- I'm asking you a question about why you endorsed someone who’s been found liable for rape. Just answer the question.
MACE: It was not a criminal court. This was – this was a – it was a civil court.
STEPHANOPOULOS: It was a civil court that found him liable for rape.
MACE: And, by the way, she joked about the judgment and what she was going to do with all that money. And I find that offensive.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm asking you about the man who’s –
MACE: But as a rape victim who’s been shamed for years now because of her rape, you're trying to shame me again by asking me this political question.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You’ve -- you've repeat that – you’ve repeated that again and again and again.
MACE: I think it’s offensive. As a woman, I find your – I find it offensive. For my political choices –
STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm asking –
MACE: I have endorsed the man that I believe is best for our country. It's not Joe Biden. And you looked at the dueling rallies yesterday in Georgia. Laken Riley's family was with Donald Trump. They weren't with Joe Biden. The same guy yesterday that apologized for calling her killer an illegal, who was an illegal. And here you are trying to shame a rape victim. I find it disgusting.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I mean you keep saying I'm shaming you. There’s nothing I –
MACE: You are. The question – it is. It is.
STEPHANOPOULOS: How is the question asking you about a presidential candidate who’s been --
MACE: You're asking a rape victim.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm – and there's no question about that. And you’re -- you've courageously talked about that.
MACE: You’re questioning my political choices because I've been raped. I think that's disgusting.
STEPHANOPOULOS: No, I'm questioning your political choices because you're supporting someone who’s been found liable for rape.
MACE: You’re shaming me. You’re trying to shame me.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Actually, I'm not trying to shame you.
MACE: You are. That's exactly what you’re doing.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You’re not answering the question.
MACE: And I think it's disgusting.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, you're welcome to say that, but you also have to answer the question.
MACE: I did.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Why are you supporting someone who’s been found liable for rape?
MACE: I just answered your question.
STEPHANOPOULOS: What is the answer?
MACE: He was not – he was not found guilty in a civil – in a criminal court of law. He -- it was a civil – it was sexual abuse. It wasn’t actually rape, by the way. And E. Jenn Carroll joked about all the money she's going to get and made a mockery out of – out of this case. And I think that's offensive.
There is a reason why women don't come forward. And when you have someone who says that they're raped and they make a mockery out of this civil court judgment, it's offensive to other women. It makes it harder for other women to come forward when another woman has made a mockery of it.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You said women don't come forward because they are afraid. They are afraid because they are defamed by those who commit –
MACE: They’re judged and shamed, like you’re trying to shame me this morning.
STEPHANOPOULOS: They – they are – they are afraid to come forward, as you said, because they are defamed by those who commit the rape.
MACE: And they’re judged.
STEPHANOPOULOS: That’s what Donald Trump has been found guilty of doing.
MACE: He defended himself over that and denies that it ever happened. But he was not found guilty in a criminal court of law. It was a civil judgment over sexual abuse.
STEPHANOPOULOS: So is that the distinction you're making, a civil judgment is – is – is OK, but a criminal judgment is not?
MACE: This is different. And – and they didn't even input all of the evidence into the – the civil case either because some of the information she provided wasn't even accurate or correct. But to sit here and ask me, as a rape victim, to – to try to shame me for my political choices, is wrong. And I think it's offensive. And you --
STEPHANOPOULOS: You can -- you can repeat that again and again and again and again and again and I've done nothing to shame you.
MACE: And I'm going to because I find it deeply offensive.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You don't find it offensive that Donald Trump has been found liable for rape?
MACE: I find it offensive, as a rape victim, that you're trying to shame me for my political choices. And I've said again repeatedly, E. Jean Carroll has made a mockery out of rape by joking about it. I don’t find that funny. Rape is not funny.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, you’ve -- you've made it perfectly clear.
MACE: Rape is serious.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You’ve made it perfectly clear, you’re comfortable –
MACE: Rape is serious. It’s not funny.
STEPHANOPOULOS: It is serious.
MACE: And it – it shouldn't be made a mockery of.
STEPHANOPOULOS: It is –
MACE: But if you want to defend a woman who made a mockery out of rape, then you go ahead and do that. I'm not going to do that.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, actually, what you’re doing is defending a man who's been found liable for rape. I don't understand how you can do that.
MACE: Not in a criminal court of law. This was a civil judgment over sexual abuse, not rape, by the way, and she made a mockery out of it. So, which one are you going to --
STEPHANOPOULOS: Can we pull up “The Washington Post” headline right there? In fact, it has been shown to be rape. The judge affirmed that it was, in fact, rape. Donald Trump was found to have committed rape. That's just a fact.
MACE: That is a civil judgment, not a criminal court. They’re two very different things and you know better.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, you’ve – I just showed you the facts right there.
MACE: You know better.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You show that you’re very comfortable with what Donald Trump has done.
MACE: And what you’ve done is offensive to women who have been raped. What you’ve done this morning is offensive.
STEPHANOPOULOS: We’ll let the viewers decide about that.
Let's talk about January 6th. You had just been sworn into Congress on January 6th. You voted to certify the election and you said Donald Trump must be held accountable for the violence right after the riot.
Let's show that.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MACE: We've got to hold not only the president accountable and ensure that he doesn't hold office again in the future, but also we need to hold members of our – of our Congress, even in my own party, accountable for the rhetoric and the actions that led up to Wednesday's events.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
STEPHANOPOULOS: You said he should never hold office again. So why are you supporting his run for president?
MACE: Well, I listened to my voters. I listened to my voters in South Carolina. And they've moved beyond January 6th. I said my piece on January 6th. I was – I was very clear about how I felt about it. And I also, as you stated, I voted to certify the electoral college for every single state in the country.
But something's happened between now and then, and that was Joe Biden. And I listen to my voters. They move on. They don't -- they don't ask me about January 6th. Maybe that's what you in the media -- you guys talk about in your cocktail parties, but voters are not talking about it.
They ask me about February 22nd, the day that Laken Riley was murdered by an illegal immigrant. They ask me about October 8th, the day that Maddie Hines, a South Carolina girl, four-year-old girl, murdered by an illegal immigrant who was deported under Donald Trump and allowed back in under Joe Biden's administration. They're talking about the over 8 million illegals who have come across our southern border in an invasion of our country and an actual threat to democracy, allowing that to happen. That's what they talk about.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Not talking about January 6th doesn't mean it didn't happen. And you were very clear right there. You said he shouldn't...
MACE: I was very clear. I just said that.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You said he should never hold office again because of what happened on January 6th, because of what he did on January 6th. You said he should be held accountable. How has he been held accountable?
MACE: Well, voters...
STEPHANOPOULOS: How are you holding him accountable?
MACE: Voters held him accountable through our Republican primaries this year. He's won overwhelmingly. America supports him. They're not looking back. They're looking forward.
Since January 6th, we've had three years of Joe Biden. The American people do not like or support it. You've seen the polling. You cited the polling in your show today showing that Trump is beating Joe Biden on all of the critical issues that the American people care about, talking about immigration, the border, inflation, et cetera.
He's very strong on those issues, stronger than Joe Biden, and that's -- I listen to my voters. I talk to South Carolinians every single day, and they support Donald Trump. He's going to win our state overwhelmingly in November.
STEPHANOPOULOS: How have you held Donald Trump accountable for what he did on January 6th?
MACE: The American people have held him accountable through the ballot box, just as they will hold Joe Biden accountable in November at the ballot box.
STEPHANOPOULOS: And you will continue to support him even if he's convicted of a felony?
MACE: Well, here's the thing. You know, the court cases, the lawsuits, that has nothing to do with you or me or the -- it doesn't affect the American people. The chaos that Joe Biden has created by having a wide-open border affects every single American. We see it -- we saw it affect Laken Riley's family on February 22nd. We've seen it affect Maddie Hines' family in South Carolina.
We've seen the violence right here in New York, in Times Square, where illegal immigrants beat up two New York Police Department cops. These things affect -- fentanyl crisis affects everybody. Ten years ago, I couldn't tell you what fentanyl was. Today, last year, I knew two people personally who died of fentanyl overdoses.
So the chaos that Joe Biden has created over the last three years has made Americans rethink who they want to have president. And we have two back-to-back presidencies to compare. They've both been president, and the American people, I believe, right now, are overwhelmingly choosing Donald Trump regardless of how you feel.
STEPHANOPOULOS: So you've made it very clear you're comfortable with Donald Trump being found liable for rape and you're comfortable with his actions on January 6th.
MACE: I didn't say I was comfortable with -- you're putting words into my mouth.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You wouldn't condemn it.
MACE: You're -- no, you're putting words into my mouth.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Are you comfortable with it?
MACE: I support Donald Trump for president. I just endorsed him...
STEPHANOPOULOS: So you're comfortable with it...
MACE: ... a few weeks ago.
STEPHANOPOULOS: ... even though he's been found liable for rape?
MACE: In a civil judgment, not a criminal court case. But you go ahead and keep shaming women who have been raped. Good luck with that.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Thank you for joining us. We'll be right back.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The real reason TikTok’s freaking out so much is that today, Congress is going to vote on whether TikTok has to cut ties with China if it wants to operate within the United States. And if it were to pass, TikTok would have six months to cut ties with China or else it's just going to be flat out banned all across America.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
STEPHANOPOULOS: The House is set to vote on a bill this week that would ban TikTok over concerns that China could threaten national security by exploiting the app. Many of its users are pushing back. Both President Biden and former President Trump have weighed in both sides, opposite sides of the issue.
We'll speak with tech expert Kara Swisher after this report from Elizabeth Schulze.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ELIZABETH SCHULZE, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's one of the most popular social media platforms on the planet, but also the source of serious national security concerns from U.S. lawmakers. Now, TikTok, the viral video-sharing app is on the verge of facing a nationwide ban after a unanimous vote this week in the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
REP. MIKE GALLAGHER (R-WI): We need this bill because we simply cannot allow an app controlled by our nation's foremost adversary and competitor to take over the American media landscape.
SCHULZE: With some 170 million users in the U.S., TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance, sparking fears that China's government could access and sell Americans' personal data, manipulate users, or promote propaganda which the company’s CEO recently denied before Congress.
SHOU CHEW, TIKTOK, CEO: Senator, we have not been asked by any data by the Chinese government, and we’ve never provided it.
SCHULZE: The legislation which would force TikTok to cut ties with its Chinese parent within six months or face a federal ban is set for a vote on the House floor this week. TikTok responding with a strong rebuke of the legislation saying, the government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their constitutional right to free expression, and sending push notifications to users calling on them to reach out to their elected officials.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know it's going down when you get this notification from TikTok.
SCHULZE: The bill which House Speaker Mike Johnson supports is also backed by President Biden.
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If they pass it, I’ll sign it.
SCHULZE: Even though just a few weeks ago, the president's campaign team launched a new TikTok account to help boost his re-election bid.

SCHULZE: Former President Trump pushed back on the legislation despite his own failed attempts to ban the app with an executive order in 2020. Now he says a TikTok ban would benefit rival app Facebook, the social media giant he called the enemy.

Kara, welcome back to ""This Week"". Thanks for joining us this morning.
Try to -- try to break down this debate for everyone. What is the concern about China? What are the prospects that TikTok will actually be banned?
KARA SWISHER, PODCAST HOST, “ON WITH KARA SWISHER”: I think it's going to happen. I think it's going to pass. I think there's bipartisan support for it.
President Trump used to be for it until he was against it. Now, in fact, had an executive order around it.

The OpenAI Board said it has ""full confidence"" in the continued leadership of Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman following a monthslong review by the law firm WilmerHale.

The board ousted Altman from OpenAI, the maker of the popular conversation bot ChatGPT, in November. Altman's unexplained exit thrust the company into disarray and sparked an employee revolt, with Brockman quitting in response.
Nearly all 800 employees at OpenAI signed a letter calling for the resignation of the company's board and the return of Altman as CEO.
Microsoft announced it had hired Altman and Brockman to lead a new artificial intelligence department. Then four days after his removal, Altman was reinstated as CEO of OpenAI. Brockman also returned to the company.

As part of its review of the events surrounding Altman's removal, WilmerHale conducted dozens of interviews with members of OpenAI’s prior Board, OpenAI executives, advisors to the prior Board, and ""other pertinent witnesses,"" as well as reviewed more than 30,000 documents, the board said.
WilmerHale found there was a ""breakdown in trust"" between the prior board and Altman that led to him stepping down in November, but that his removal wasn't warranted, the board said.
""WilmerHale found that the prior Board believed at the time that its actions would mitigate internal management challenges and did not anticipate that its actions would destabilize the Company,"" the board said. ""WilmerHale found the prior Board implemented its decision on an abridged timeframe, without advance notice to key stakeholders, and without a full inquiry or an opportunity for Mr. Altman to address the prior Board’s concerns.""

2024-03-08,Melinda Gates says AI in pregnancy could help save women's lives,Gates spoke to ABC News' Dr. Jennifer Ashton about the state of women's health.,"Each day, almost 800 women around the world die due to preventable pregnancy and childbirth-related causes, according to the World Health Organization.
Using artificial intelligence, or AI, to provide maternal health care to women, especially those in rural and low-income areas, could be a ""game-changer"" in saving the lives of pregnant women, Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, told ABC News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton.
Gates highlighted a specific tool, AI-enabled ultrasound, that is revolutionizing pregnant women's access to ultrasounds, or sonograms, a prenatal test that uses sound waves to check a baby's development during pregnancy, and check for pregnancy complications.
Ultrasounds are a routine part of prenatal care to which two-thirds of pregnant women around the world do not have access, according to the Gates Foundation.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is working to increase access globally to AI-enabled ultrasound devices.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
""If you're a mom, let's say in the United States, when you go in and you get an ultrasound, it's quite a large machine. You go into a special room to have it done,"" Gates told Ashton, a board-certified OB-GYN and obesity medicine physician, in an interview to mark International Women's Day, March 8. ""We were able, with our partners, to come up with a very small AI-assisted ultrasound that literally can plug into your phone or plug into a tablet.""
The portable ultrasound device, which typically weighs less than a pound, can display the ultrasound images on the smartphone or tablet, so health care professionals -- whether nurses, doctors or midwives -- can read the ultrasound instantly, allowing for faster diagnoses and faster treatment.
""In these low-resource settings, [pregnant] women often ... can't get into a community health clinic. The lines are long. They don't have the bus fare. They might walk. It might be shut down or not open at the right time of day,"" Gates said. ""A community health worker goes out to these women so she can have an AI-enabled ultrasound and, literally with a few scans of that mom's belly, be able to see, is the child growing properly? Is the mom's health OK in terms of what you can see in the ultrasound?""
Gates continued, ""It's a game-changer ... it's a pretty simple device, but again, it really can make a difference in terms of the mom and the baby.""
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is working to increase access globally to AI-enabled ultrasound devices.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
Gates said now that the technology exists, the Gates Foundation is working with partners to try to lower the price of the devices and get more health care workers trained so they can go to more underserved communities.
The AI ultrasound technology is one of several advancements that Gates said she sees as transformative for women's health care, which has historically been underfunded and under-researched on a global level, data shows.
""We know that women can't do well unless they are well, so you first have to start and be healthy to then be able to get an education and to work productively in society,"" Gates said. ""So when you think about how little funding is going into actually saving women's lives, from diseases that are specific to women, to childbirth, which is very specific to women, that just shouldn't be.""
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is working to increase access globally to AI-enabled ultrasound devices.

Any advancements being made for women's health -- like a one-dose HPV vaccine to prevent cervical cancer and a drape that can reduce a woman's chance of dying from postpartum hemorrhaging by 60% -- can only make a difference, Gates noted, if they reach the women who need them.
The HPV vaccine, for example, was approved in the United States in 2006 by the Food and Drug Administration but is just now reaching millions of women in need in Africa as a one-dose vaccine. HPV is a common sexually transmitted infection that, if left untreated, can invade the cervical cells of the uterus and cause cancer.
In 2022, cervical cancer led to 350,000 deaths globally, with the highest rates of mortality in low and middle-income countries, according to the WHO.

Gates said for more than a decade, female leaders in Africa have asked her for the vaccine on her trips to the continent.
""They're saying, 'We have full communities where we see aunts, sisters dying of cervical cancer. You have this vaccine in the United States, when are we going to get it?'"" Gates recalled. ""And the issue has been it's an expensive vaccine and it's two doses.""
Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, speaks with people in Malawi.
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
With the lower-priced one-dose vaccine now available, Gates said the HPV vaccine can be distributed in places like schools and community clinics.
""We can give it out in places where they gather,"" Gates said. ""So often a young girl never makes it into the clinic. She may not ever make it in clinic at all until after she's had a child, or she might make it in at the time of birth, and that's too late.""
Another women's health advancement, longer-lasting and injectable contraceptives, have the potential to not only transform women's health, but all aspects of their lives, including their economic well-being. According to the Gates Foundation, over 250 million women and girls globally who do not want to get pregnant are still not using modern contraceptive methods.
Gates said if she could make one change to women's health, she would focus solely on contraceptives.
""It would be that every single girl and women on this planet who wants to have access to a contraceptive can have access,"" Gates said. ""We know that when women can time and space the birth of their children, women are healthier. The children are healthier. The family is wealthier.""
She continued, ""So I would make sure every single woman had access to contraceptives so she could decide when and whether to have a child.""
How being a mom, grandmother motivates her work for women's health
Gates, who lives in Seattle, is a mom of three, who became a first-time grandmother last year when her eldest daughter Jenn Gates Nassar gave birth to a daughter.

Gates said she was with her daughter while she was in labor, which made her reflect on the care her daughter received in the U.S., versus what she would have been able to receive if she delivered in a lower-income country.
""I could sit there ... and think about all the places I've been in the developing world where I've been in the delivery room and think, 'Oh my gosh, if my daughter didn't have somebody here taking her blood pressure,' or, 'I know what hemorrhage looks like. I know what the pain of childbirth is like in these settings,'"" Gates said. ""So, to see that my daughter was getting good care, and still you're concerned at the time of the birth of a baby, it's a bit scary until that baby comes healthy, I could think about all those things.""
Even in the U.S., with its advanced health care, the state of maternal and infant health is dire, data shows.

Gates said she believes ""no mom"" should die in childbirth anywhere in the world.

2024-03-07,Chinese national arrested after allegedly stealing AI trade secrets from Google,"Prosecutors say Linwei Ding, 38, allegedly stole confidential trade secrets and secretly started to work for two China-based AI tech startups.","A Chinese national was arrested Wednesday in California and charged with allegedly stealing confidential trade secrets from Google's Artificial Intelligence program while secretly working for two AI startup companies based in China, according to a newly unsealed indictment.
Linwei Ding, a 38-year-old resident of Newark, joined Google as a software engineer in 2019 and was tasked with developing the software used by the tech giant in their supercomputing data centers, according to court records.
But prosecutors say three years into the job, he allegedly began secretly stealing confidential trade secrets -- including ""the building blocks"" of the company's data centers that were used for training AI models to understand language and generate responses to queries, court records show.
Over a roughly year-long span, Ding is alleged to have uploaded more than 500 files with confidential information, all while prosecutors allege he was secretly starting to work for two China-based AI tech startups -- including one he founded himself.
Ding allegedly traveled to China on two separate instances -- October 2022 and November 2023 -- to participate in business meetings and even attend a conference where he pitched his company to prospective investors, according to court records.
Google joins effort to increase transparency online with new digital standard
According to one document obtained by prosecutors, Ding advertised his company's services by specifically citing his experience with Google's supercomputer platform.
""We just need to replicate and upgrade it -- and then further develop a computational power platform suited to China's national conditions,"" the document said, court records show.
Ding is also alleged to have taken specific steps to avoid being caught by Google, including copying secret files into his Google Cloud by first copying them into his Apple Notes application and then converting them to PDFs, according to court documents.

In December 2023, Google was alerted to him uploading some files and he was confronted by an internal investigator, court documents show. Ding allegedly told the investigator he uploaded it as evidence of the work he was doing but that he had no intention of leaving the company.
That same week, Ding allegedly had a fellow employee scan his Google access badge at the building three separate times to make it appear as if he was there, prosecutors claim, and soon after booked a one-way ticket to Beijing. He then emailed his resignation to his manager, according to court records, and the company soon after learned of his presentation at the investor conference. The FBI was alerted and secured warrants to search Ding's house and Google Cloud account.
Ding was taken into custody Wednesday morning and faces four federal counts of theft of trade secrets. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison for each count. He did not have an attorney listed on his court docket as of Wednesday afternoon.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-03-05,Woman speaks out after falling victim to ‘malicious tagging’ scam,"""Malicious tagging,"" or provocative social media post scams, are becoming more common, according to experts, and are typically either sent through social media.","For one high school student in New Jersey, a single computer science competition fueled a mission to get more teenage girls interested in artificial intelligence, or AI.
Ishani Singh, now 17, was a freshman at High Technology High School in 2021 when she attended a state computer science competition, where she noticed she was only one of a few female students competing.
When Singh went onto compete in the regional competition, she said she was ""shocked"" to see that she was the only female student competing.
""I looked around and there were, like, zero girls, and I was like, 'OK,'"" Singh told ABC News in an interview airing on ""The Year: 2024,"" an annual special airing Dec. 26 on ABC. ""That felt a little weird.""
The experience inspired Singh, now a high school senior, to launch Girls Rule AI, which aims to empower young women to learn about AI, a term that, according to NASA, ""refers to computer systems that can perform complex tasks normally done by human-reasoning, decision making, creating, etc.""
Ishani Singh founded Girls Rule AI after attending a computer science competition where she was the only girl.
ABC News
Since the start of the organization nearly three years ago, Girls Rule AI has taught free courses on AI to over 200 girls in 25 states and six countries around the world, including Kenya and Afghanistan, according to Singh.
Gloria Mwangi, a Girls Rule AI instructor in Kenya, said she believes women working in AI-related fields could be transformative.
""In Kenya, the interest in tech and AI is definitely growing,"" Mwangi told ABC News. ""I think AI has a lot of potential to make a difference for young women here.""
Singh added that the success of her company, she believes, has been in making AI more accessible to more girls.

""I think it's just because girls are a little afraid to just start on this journey in the first place,"" Singh said of the gender difference in AI. ""So, I think by creating this community, I was able to make girls feel a little more more comfortable and just get them more confident in this field.""
Even with the progress, Singh said she feels there is a lot of work to do when it comes to getting girls interested in AI so they can go onto careers in the science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, industries.
According to the American Association of University Women, women currently make up 34% of the STEM workforce and are particularly outnumbered by men in fast-growing and high-paying fields like engineering and computer science.
""We're not at the level that we should be,"" Singh said. ""I think there should be more women in the tech field.""

2024-03-05,AI is driving a stock market rally. What if the technology falters?,Proponents say AI will revolutionize business. Critics warn it may never come.,"Ten days after the Super Bowl, Wall Street held its own version -- at least that's the way some traders on social media described it.
Nvidia, which had soared to prominence selling the majority of chips behind the artificial intelligence boom, was set to release buzzy quarterly earnings that could move markets.
The company didn't disappoint, shattering expectations with a 265% surge in revenue compared to a year earlier.
The following day, the S&P 500 jumped 2.5%; while the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose nearly 3%.
""That was strictly because of Nvidia's good earnings. It demonstrated the power of AI,"" Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at trading firm Interactive Brokers, told ABC News.
""But I was wondering: What if we flipped it on its head and Nvidia failed to deliver?"" Sosnick added. ""If you live by a narrow group of stocks and that group is really dragging the market higher, it increases the level of risk.""

The stock market has climbed since the outset of last year, driven in large part by a group of major tech companies propelled by enthusiasm over AI. Bulls said the trend exemplifies typical concentration at the beginning of a technological revolution, as a few firms with outsized resources develop and popularize AI.
Critics, however, warn that profit-making uses of AI remain a far-off vision, risking a market downturn if the technology falls short of the watershed that boosters have promised. Many people with 401(k)s and college funds dependent on the S&P 500 could end up burned, some analysts told ABC News.
""AI has gone into hyperdrive,"" Sosnick said. ""Everyday people buy into the S&P 500 because they think it's a diverse set of stocks. With the concentration right now, that's an underappreciated risk.""
Major stock indexes drew a bump in recent months from investors optimistic about benefits of the newly prominent technology.
However, those gains were concentrated primarily in a handful of tech giants, known as the so-called ""Magnificent 7"": Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia.
Since the S&P 500 is weighted based on company value, larger firms make up a bigger share of the index. The Magnificent 7 accounted for nearly two-thirds of the index's 24% gain in 2023, a Reuters analysis found.
""The AI revolution has been the fuel in the engine for the tech bull market and the broader markets,"" Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at investment firm Wedbush, told ABC News.
Microsoft, the most valuable company in the world, saw its shares soar nearly 75% since the beginning of last year.
That stretch began with an announcement, in January 2023, that Microsoft was investing $10 billion in OpenAI, the artificial intelligence firm that developed ChatGPT. Months later, Microsoft's Bing became the default search engine for ChatGPT.
Apple, the world's second largest company, is working on plans to incorporate generative AI into all of its devices, Bloomberg reported in October. Earlier this month, Nvidia became the third-largest company on the planet.

Analysts bullish on the market acknowledge the concentration at the top but expect the AI-driven gains to broaden as the technology pervades the economy and smaller companies gain notoriety.
""Chatbots are just the tip of the iceberg,"" Mike Loukas, CEO of TrueMark Investments, which specializes in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. ""The AI revolution is real and it's here to stay.""
TrueMark Investments offers an ETF that allows investors to buy shares pegged to a basket of roughly two-dozen AI-related firms, spanning from Nvidia to a host of lesser-known names. The ETF has surged 52% over the past year.
""To me, the early stages are always reflective of people buying what they can see and touch and understand,"" Loukas added. ""Right now, that's the big companies in the news that are blowing the doors off of earnings. It will broaden out.""
The flood of investment in AI has elicited corporate spending on the technology, which will thrust the technology into the wider market and boost further gains, said Ives.
""We're going to see the ripple effect from this massive spending wave,"" Ives said.
Skeptics abound, however. They point to what they consider a lack of evidence that AI will be of use to firms beyond a narrow set of tech juggernauts. Without wider adoption, they say, the market explosion could fizzle.
A study released last month by a group of researchers at major universities and federal agencies found fewer than 6% of firms used AI-related technologies, though a majority of very large firms reported at least some AI use.

Kristina McElheran, a business professor at the University Toronto and a co-author of the study, said observers face difficulty accurately assessing private sector use of AI, since there is not a single agreed-upon definition of the technology and some companies keep their efforts secret.
However, market euphoria about AI risks outpacing what appears to be modest adoption so far, McElheran added.
""What I am worried about is that the rate and level of excitement and investment is exceeding the rate and level of actual absorption and adoption inside firms,"" McElheran said. ""That disconnect is troublesome.""
Sosnick, of Interactive Brokers, said an AI boom would require adoption from companies big and small that lack an immediate connection to the technology.
""If you're just a regular company, it's not clear how AI is benefiting you yet,"" Sosnick said. ""Is this helping Pepsi do their work more efficiently? Hard to say.""
Nvidia, Sosnick added, is ""essentially selling the picks and shovels to the gold miners.""

2024-03-04,Threats to health care sector targets likely to stay 'elevated' amid cultural wars: DHS,"Threats to health care and workers are surging and likely to stay “elevated"" because of divisive issues like abortion, gender-related care, and debates from the pandemic.","Threats to health care locations and those who work there are surging and are likely to stay ""elevated,"" as a result of cultural and divisive issues like abortion, gender-related care and a hangover from debates caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, federal intelligence analysts said.
The brew of hot-button socio-medical issues litigated both in the public square and in the courts will ""amplify the health care sector's visibility as a potential target for attack"" by domestic extremists, according to a new briefing memo issued by the Department of Homeland Security on Feb. 26.

The confidential analysis, obtained by ABC News, describes a diverse array of dangers these mounting threats could pose: from harm to patients through compromised care, to causing a chilling effect on clinicians through harassment and intimidation, to ideologically motivated cyber attacks targeting health care providers and networks.
""Violent extremist threats against the health care and public health sector have diversified since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, and will likely remain elevated in the post-pandemic era due to the expansion of medical-related ideological grievances,"" the DHS bulletin said.
MORE: 3 states are holding simultaneous contests for Republican presidential nomination
A recent ""escalation in threats of violence targeting health care facilities and personnel"" has included ""hoax bomb threats against hospitals, attempts to incite violence through doxing [public release of personal information like addresses and phone numbers] and calls to execute particular physicians, public officials, or pharmaceutical executives,"" the bulletin said.
The ""surge"" in threats aligns with an increase in public dialogue surrounding medical issues that have been amplified by legislation and debate, according to the bulletin.

Since the pandemic upended life, the threat spectrum has ""expanded"" to ""other ideological grievances, as highlighted by an increase in abortion or gender-affirming care-related threats"" that are ""explicitly based on narratives and conspiracy theories popular with violent extremists"" keying in on those divisive issues, the bulletin said.
""Our society is very angry and very polarized -- an increasing number of people in the US have come to believe that those who disagree are the enemy, and, that violence is an acceptable way to express their disagreement,"" said John Cohen, the former intelligence chief at DHS and now an ABC News contributor.

For those who would seek to exploit societal fractures in America, an us-versus-them mentality is applied to the most contentious wedge issues and provides a handy crowbar, experts say.
""Violent extremists, terror groups, foreign intelligence services have purposely sought to exploit public policy issues being debated in the U.S. that are the most polarizing, that they believe will inspire a volatile reaction – and hopefully violent acts,"" Cohen added.
Threats of violence have not remained hypothetical as real attacks have been directed at perceived epicenters of extremists' grievances.

Last week, a California man pleaded guilty to firebombing a Planned Parenthood clinic with a Molotov cocktail in March 2022. It followed guilty pleas from others involved in the firebombing, which forced the clinic to temporarily close and reschedule roughly 30 patient appointments.
The defendant sought to ""scare pregnant women away from obtaining abortions; deter doctors, staff, and employees at the clinic from providing abortions; and intimidate the clinic's patients,"" according to the Department of Justice. Following the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022, he and co-conspirators ""planned to use a second Molotov cocktail to attack another Planned Parenthood clinic."" A year later, they were arrested two days before an LGBTQ ""Pride Night"" at Dodger Stadium, which they had planned to attack, the DOJ said.

In September 2023, a Massachusetts woman pleaded guilty to calling in a false bomb threat against Boston Children's Hospital – which, among the wide range of health care services it provides, is home to a health care program focused on gender-diverse and transgender adolescents.
""There is a bomb on the way to the hospital, you better evacuate everybody you sickos,"" the woman had threatened on the call, according to DOJ -- prompting a bomb squad to be dispatched and forcing the hospital and the surrounding area to go into lockdown.

""It was obviously scary. This is not the kind of thing you want to have in a health system,"" said John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor -- adding that he was on the hospital campus that day.
""Part of the issue is there's a ton of misinformation,"" Brownstein said. ""When someone takes it beyond just commentary -- and makes an attempt to turn an internet-based conversation into a real-world threat.""
That health care has become a target poses a uniquely troubling concern, experts say: it directly attacks citizens' well-being -- and creates a ripple effect of bodily harm.
These threats have ""compromised patient care and medical services across a broader cross-section of health care systems and other medical providers"" since the pandemic era, the DHS bulletin said. Those ""recurring threats"" could ""likely reduce the ability of clinicians and facilities to provide care,"" the bulletin said.
The worst may be yet to come, the bulletin suggests: In a year of the first presidential election since the pandemic and the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, leading candidates are running on some of the most divisive issues -- from reproductive rights to gender and culture wars, to immigration at the Southern border, to the multiple wars abroad -- which authorities have said could prove to be flashpoints.
""Government action in the health care sector over the coming year, including in response to public health crises, and public discourse involving controversial medical issues may escalate threats of violence to acts of violence,"" the DHS bulletin said, adding court decisions on ""mail order access to abortion medication and state legislation prohibiting the provision of gender-affirming treatments to minors are especially likely to heighten the potential for violence against the sector.""

And for adversaries seeking to undermine U.S. societal stability -- chipping away at a crucial bedrock like health care presents an appealing means.
""It's the goal of U.S. adversaries to not only destabilize our society but to have people lose confidence in government,"" Cohen said. ""In the election process, in critical infrastructure -- our power grid, financial institutions and our health care systems -- those are the fundamental things that people rely on each and every day to live their lives.""
In the wake of a pandemic that further fueled division, ""the environment here in the U.S. has become more fertile for our adversaries,"" Cohen said. ""We anticipate this high level of threat-related activity is only going to increase as we get closer to the election.""
MORE: It's become more difficult to identify motivations behind mass casualty attacks: DHS
With the exponential power and pervasiveness of artificial intelligence and the internet -- and as society relies more on both -- the threat gets even more complex, even as online social media provides a platform for conspiracy theories and extremist thought.
""Ideologically-motivated cyber actors increasingly target health care entities during periods when socio-politically divisive topics are prevalent in public discourse,"" the bulletin said.
Even “absent attacks, recurring threats of violence may still have a chilling effect” on providers, “resulting in more acute or widespread barriers to patient care,” the bulletin said.
""If the people engaging in these activities are successful, it will interrupt the ability of people to receive appropriate health care or protect themselves and their community from public health hazards. And when that occurs, people die,"" Cohen said.",, but this is a very sharp turn for the Republican leader.,,,,,,,,,,

Cat eye
""Be sure to choose the right eyeliner -- liquid may be best for those with more advanced eyeliner skills, but pencil eyeliners are versatile, easier to control, and a bit more forgiving when applying,"" Brown told ""Good Morning America"".
""With one pencil, you can get the look of a liquid or gel slick cat eye -- or blend it out with a brush to get something a little more relaxed and soft.""

Pops of color
""Amanda Seyfried's green eyes popped more than ever thanks to her smoky purple eyeshadow look,"" Brown said.
Brown suggested keeping things balanced, noting that the actress's eyes popped because the rest of her makeup took a secondary role.
""To pull focus to her plum-swept lids, her liner, lashes, complexion, and lips remained understated and neutral,"" she said.
She continued, ""This purple eye shadow is impactful because it utilizes red-based purple pigments. Colors that are opposites on the color wheel create the most contrast -- green eyes will stand out most when surrounded by colors in the red family.""

2024-03-01,Can AI book your trip for less?,"""GMA"" explores if the technology knows how to plan a fun and affordable trip for you and your family.","With this holiday travel season expected to be the busiest on record, anything from inclement weather to a looming government shutdown has prompted airline passengers to ponder every possible scenario to ensure they still make it to their holiday destination.
Whatever the worry, travel experts have weighed in to help alleviate some possible pre-flight concerns with answers to your most commonly asked air travel conundrums.
Travelers wade through the south security checkpoint in Denver International Airport, Dec. 19, 2024.
David Zalubowski/AP
""We are expecting to see 50% more people traveling over the 12 day winter holiday period vs. the busy nine day Thanksgiving period,"" travel expert at Going, Katy Nastro told ""GMA."" ""Just a few days equals a lot more people on the road, so make sure you're adding a bit of buffer to your transit times to the airport, especially during peak windows AAA suggests for metro cities.""
How a government shutdown would impact holiday travel
""Air travel will operate business as usual for the busy holiday period. However, the longer this goes on, the longer TSA employees and Air Traffic Controllers go without pay,"" she explained, adding that past elongated shutdowns have led to ""personnel calling out sick and strained skeleton crews trying to fill the gaps, which lead to longer than usual security lines.""
How early should I arrive at the airport during the holidays?
If ever there was a time to be an early bird at the airport, it's now.
Whether you're a frequent flyer and carry-on queen, ditching the potential long lines of overweight, gift-filled luggage check in, or regularly rely on TSA PreCheck to ensure expedited access through dedicated security lanes, agencies have already warned that this will be the busiest travel season on record, period.
""With record numbers of travelers expected, even more time factored into your airport experience can't hurt,"" Nastro suggested.
The Transportation Security Administration said it expects to screen nearly 40 million travelers from Dec. 19 to Jan. 2, which is up 6.2% from last year.
The three most crowded days to fly over the coming days, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, will be Thursday, Dec. 19, followed by Friday, Dec. 27, and Friday, Dec. 20.
United said it's planning for the busiest holiday rush ever, with 9.9 million ticketed passengers set to fly between Dec. 19 and Jan. 6. The airline said it's adding almost 500 more flights per day during its holiday travel period. The Chicago-based carrier anticipates Friday, Dec. 20, Friday, Dec. 27, and Saturday, Dec. 28 to be its busiest days.
What to do if your flight is delayed during the holidays
First, always have your airline's app downloaded to see the most up to date information with notifications turned on. In most airline apps, you can see where your inbound plane is coming from to get an expectation of the status so you'll be the first to know if there is a delay expected.

Nick Ewen, senior editorial director of The Points Guy, previously told ""Good Morning America"" that apps such as FlightRadar24 can ""show you the registration number of the plane scheduled to operate your flight,"" which can be helpful to navigate next steps if yours is nowhere to be seen.
""If you're waiting to depart from New York in two hours and your plane is still sitting in Texas, you're not leaving on time -- even if the airline's system is saying your flight is on schedule,"" he said of how the tool can provide more insight.
3:09
With a massive winter storm on the way, ABC News’ Gio Benitez shares top tips to avoid getting stranded on the holidays.
Airline expert Scott Keyes, founder of Going, formerly Scott's Cheap Flights, shared his top tip for delays that either make you miss a connecting flight or force you to rebook: Pick up the phone as soon as possible.
""Especially if there's bad weather, a lot of people will be calling, so don't just stand in line at the airport to talk to a gate agent,"" Keyes told ""GMA."" ""You want to also make sure you call the airline. But specifically call the airline's international number.""
This handy hack will bypass the main U.S. hotline, Keyes said, which most everybody else would also be calling.
Under the new regulations from the Department of Transportation, if there is a clear disruption to your flight on any airline -- constituted as three hours or more for domestic flights and six hours or more for international flights -- the carrier is required to automatically give cash refunds to passengers.
What to do if your flight is canceled while traveling during the holidays
""Flight disruptions are stressful. The only other thing on par with that level of travel stress might be navigating refunds when you choose not to get rebooked by the airline,"" travel expert Katy Nastro told ""GMA"" previously.
Thankfully, as ""GMA"" reported previously, new federal regulations that went into effect earlier this year require airlines to make it easier for ticketed passengers to get refunded after cancellations or other significant flight changes, which are also now required to be more clearly defined.
Travelers can now easily receive automatic refunds if they opt not to take a rebooked flight due to significant disruptions. However, this doesn't mean travelers can get both a refund and a new flight -- the new federal regulation only covers one or the other.

How to use AirTags to track luggage

The longtime tech travel hack is a great way to ensure you know exactly where your bags are once you've checked them in before security, or even if you have to gate check.
Now, major airlines like United are implementing the Find My technology to pinpoint your luggage on the off chance it does go missing or doesn't make it to your final destination.
Check out how it works here.
""For everyone else, having the AirTag packed is always a good idea, even for a carry-on,"" Nastro said. ""With flights likely packed to the brim, overhead bin space is likely going to be prime real estate and folks will need to gate check. Keep the AirTag packed just in case so you can keep an eye on your carry-on's whereabouts as well.""
Airlines are also cracking down on their two-piece luggage limit and expanded carry-ons. To ensure you aren't singled out when going through security or boarding, ensure you have bags combined prior to walking through the airport's doors.
Gifts: Another reminder to avoid getting stopped through security is to ensure any gifts you are carrying on are unwrapped and meet the 3-1-1 rules. If it's spreadable or sprayable, it must meet requirements. However, you can bring frozen liquids; just ensure they are rock solid before security.
What to do if someone asks to switch seats on a plane
One of the great air travel debates that really relies on your personal experience in the moment -- to switch seats with a fellow passenger if they ask or not?
Whether it's a parent with a child who desperately wants your window view or another request, Rosalinda Randall, an etiquette expert, told ""GMA"" that no one is obligated to switch seats on a plane if asked to do so.
""You can always ask. What I tell people is, if you're going to ask, have a good reason."" However, she noted, ""be ready when someone replies to you with the answer that you weren't expecting.""
Nastro reflected on the age old travel adage of ""pack your patience"" that she said ""should get an update to practice 'empathy in the air.'""
""We are all trying to get to where we are going this holiday season, and it can't hurt to come from a place of understanding,"" Nastro reminded.

2024-02-29,"How scientists discovered 7,000 humpback whale deaths using AI technology: Study",A study has found that a marine heatwave may have led to the decline of humpback whales.,"The intersection of marine biology and artificial intelligence technology has led to a startling humpback whale population discovery.
Approximately 7,000 humpback whales in the North Pacific Ocean died between 2012 and 2021 after the damaging effects of a yearslong marine heatwave, according to a study published Wednesday by Royal Society Open Science. It represented a 20% decline during this period.
The marine heatwave began in 2013 and lasted until 2021, steeply raising water temperatures and decreasing ocean productivity worldwide.

In the North Pacific, the study found the humpback whale population dwindled from 33,500 in 2012 to 26,500 by 2021.

The massive, international study gathered data and images from 46 organizations and 4,292 community science contributors and used AI technology to match and identify humpback whales around the world efficiently.
""We brought together data for over 30,000 individual humpback whales in over 200,000 encounters, something that would have been effectively impossible without AI-powered automated image recognition,"" Dr. Ted Cheeseman, lead researcher of the study, told ABC News. ""It changes the landscape of research, providing a cost-effective tool that gives us some hope of keeping up with the pace of ecosystem change.""
In the past, whale populations were estimated by methods such as manual ship surveys, with much smaller sample sizes, but the implementation of AI matching techniques allowed for more widespread data to be included -- and showed the substantial population decline of humpback whales in the North Pacific, according to the study.

AI technology used photo matching to identify individual humpback whales based on the shape of their tail flukes and their pigment patterns.
""I'm excited because this pioneers a new way of doing research,"" John Calambokidis, senior research biologist and co-author of the study, told ABC News. ""It brings more researchers and people together and creates a more collaborative and supportive atmosphere for research going forward.""

The humpback whale images and data were aggregated via a platform called Happywhale, where researchers and whale watchers alike submitted whale photos for this study and future research.
So far, nearly 800,000 photos have been submitted to Happywhale, which has led to the identification of more than 100,000 individual whales, according to the site.
""One of the exciting developments of Happywhale, crowdsourcing, and automated matching, is that it led to more contributions by citizen scientists and whale watchers,"" Calambokidis said.

""We're learning that the changes going on in the environment can have huge consequences to long-lived species, like whales, that people cherish and value,"" Calambokidis said, noting, ""This is important to motivate protection and conservation.""

Despite the remarkable recovery in humpback whale populations after the International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling in 1986, Calambokidis said this comprehensive study shows the stark reality of climate change's impact on marine life.
""It's only been in more recent years that scientists really have gotten a handle on how whale populations recovered from commercial whaling,"" Calambokidis said.

Calambokidis noted that despite humpback populations increasing along the U.S. West Coast, this international study shows, ""Overall, the humpback population has declined in recent years. It seems to be related to climate-driven changes that have lowered the carrying capacity for humpback whales.""
The marine heatwave -- referred to by researchers as ""the blob"" -- had a sweeping impact on the ecosystem from phytoplankton lacking nutrients all the way up the food chain to whales, sea lions, and sea birds facing food shortages.

""The aspects that are distressing are the magnitude and the duration of these cyclical patterns that are naturally occurring,"" Dr. Ari Friedlaender, a professor of ocean studies at UC Santa Cruz told ABC News.
""Animals may be able to withstand shorter or less frequent marine heatwaves, but if they become more common and bigger anomalies, then it becomes very challenging for ecosystems to handle.""
Commenting on the impact of the study, Friedlaender said, ""It raises the flag, but it doesn't answer the question of how do we protect and conserve these animals?""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-02-28,The real harm being caused by deepfakes,"""GMA"" explores the growing prevalence of the artificial intelligence product and how they're making an impact in the real lives of everyday people.","For one high school student in New Jersey, a single computer science competition fueled a mission to get more teenage girls interested in artificial intelligence, or AI.
Ishani Singh, now 17, was a freshman at High Technology High School in 2021 when she attended a state computer science competition, where she noticed she was only one of a few female students competing.
When Singh went onto compete in the regional competition, she said she was ""shocked"" to see that she was the only female student competing.
""I looked around and there were, like, zero girls, and I was like, 'OK,'"" Singh told ABC News in an interview airing on ""The Year: 2024,"" an annual special airing Dec. 26 on ABC. ""That felt a little weird.""
The experience inspired Singh, now a high school senior, to launch Girls Rule AI, which aims to empower young women to learn about AI, a term that, according to NASA, ""refers to computer systems that can perform complex tasks normally done by human-reasoning, decision making, creating, etc.""
Ishani Singh founded Girls Rule AI after attending a computer science competition where she was the only girl.
ABC News
Since the start of the organization nearly three years ago, Girls Rule AI has taught free courses on AI to over 200 girls in 25 states and six countries around the world, including Kenya and Afghanistan, according to Singh.
Gloria Mwangi, a Girls Rule AI instructor in Kenya, said she believes women working in AI-related fields could be transformative.
""In Kenya, the interest in tech and AI is definitely growing,"" Mwangi told ABC News. ""I think AI has a lot of potential to make a difference for young women here.""
Singh added that the success of her company, she believes, has been in making AI more accessible to more girls.

""I think it's just because girls are a little afraid to just start on this journey in the first place,"" Singh said of the gender difference in AI. ""So, I think by creating this community, I was able to make girls feel a little more more comfortable and just get them more confident in this field.""
Even with the progress, Singh said she feels there is a lot of work to do when it comes to getting girls interested in AI so they can go onto careers in the science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, industries.
According to the American Association of University Women, women currently make up 34% of the STEM workforce and are particularly outnumbered by men in fast-growing and high-paying fields like engineering and computer science.
""We're not at the level that we should be,"" Singh said. ""I think there should be more women in the tech field.""

Singh added that she believes the more young girls who become interested in AI, the greater the experience will be for all people who use the technology.
""If we have this growing surge of interest among girls and women in the field ... they'll be able to provide valuable input into the AI models that we're putting out into the world these days,"" she said. ""So, it's great to see that people have the same passion that I do.""

Semiconductors are not only vital to everyday life used in household items like dishwashers and refrigerators, but also national defense items.
Raimondo said it takes ""tens of thousands"" of ""leading edge semiconductor CHIPS"" to train a large language model like ChatGPT.
In order for the United States to keep up with demand, the U.S. has to think not only short-term but long-term as well, Raimondo said.

""We need to make these chips in America, we need more tablets available in America,"" she said. ""We need more research and development in America. And we take a lot more manufacturing and scale.""
Other countries, like China, ""aren't shy"" about the ambitions they have about making CHIPS.
""The Chinese are taking an increasingly ambitious role in increasing their own chip production,"" she said.

The Secretary admitted that conversations with CHIP company CEO's gunning for federal money aren't always easy and that out of the 600 statements of interest they received, not everyone will get federal money.
""Our job is to make targeted investments in relentless pursuit of achieving our national security objectives,"" she said.
Raimondo also said the Commerce Department is prioritizing CHIPs projects that'll be operational by 2030.
""It's not responsible to give money to a project that will come online you know, 10 or 12 years from now,"" she said.
She said she is confident that the United States will make 20% of the world's semiconductors by the end of the decade.
Raimondo said she wants to start training kids to manufacture chips starting in High School.

2024-02-26,Could your job be replaced by AI?,"""GMA"" explores which employees are at risk and how to protect your job from being replaced by the technology.","For one high school student in New Jersey, a single computer science competition fueled a mission to get more teenage girls interested in artificial intelligence, or AI.
Ishani Singh, now 17, was a freshman at High Technology High School in 2021 when she attended a state computer science competition, where she noticed she was only one of a few female students competing.
When Singh went onto compete in the regional competition, she said she was ""shocked"" to see that she was the only female student competing.
""I looked around and there were, like, zero girls, and I was like, 'OK,'"" Singh told ABC News in an interview airing on ""The Year: 2024,"" an annual special airing Dec. 26 on ABC. ""That felt a little weird.""
The experience inspired Singh, now a high school senior, to launch Girls Rule AI, which aims to empower young women to learn about AI, a term that, according to NASA, ""refers to computer systems that can perform complex tasks normally done by human-reasoning, decision making, creating, etc.""
Ishani Singh founded Girls Rule AI after attending a computer science competition where she was the only girl.
ABC News
Since the start of the organization nearly three years ago, Girls Rule AI has taught free courses on AI to over 200 girls in 25 states and six countries around the world, including Kenya and Afghanistan, according to Singh.
Gloria Mwangi, a Girls Rule AI instructor in Kenya, said she believes women working in AI-related fields could be transformative.
""In Kenya, the interest in tech and AI is definitely growing,"" Mwangi told ABC News. ""I think AI has a lot of potential to make a difference for young women here.""
Singh added that the success of her company, she believes, has been in making AI more accessible to more girls.

""I think it's just because girls are a little afraid to just start on this journey in the first place,"" Singh said of the gender difference in AI. ""So, I think by creating this community, I was able to make girls feel a little more more comfortable and just get them more confident in this field.""
Even with the progress, Singh said she feels there is a lot of work to do when it comes to getting girls interested in AI so they can go onto careers in the science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, industries.
According to the American Association of University Women, women currently make up 34% of the STEM workforce and are particularly outnumbered by men in fast-growing and high-paying fields like engineering and computer science.
""We're not at the level that we should be,"" Singh said. ""I think there should be more women in the tech field.""

Singh added that she believes the more young girls who become interested in AI, the greater the experience will be for all people who use the technology.
""If we have this growing surge of interest among girls and women in the field ... they'll be able to provide valuable input into the AI models that we're putting out into the world these days,"" she said. ""So, it's great to see that people have the same passion that I do.""

날짜 없음,Jackie Robinson statue cleats heading to Negro Leagues Baseball Museum,요약 없음,"WICHITA, Kan. -- The bronze cleats from a Jackie Robinson statue that was cut at the ankles and stolen last month will be donated to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, the league's executive director told ESPN on Friday.
""We thought it was the absolute right thing to do,"" said Bob Lutz, who founded and operates League 42, which was named after the baseball Hall of Famer and civil rights icon. ""It's looking like the cleats will be delivered by April 11, definitely before Jackie Robinson Day [April 15].""
Bob Kendrick, president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, said Friday that there are plans to have a ceremony when the cleats arrive at the museum. Kendrick said the cleats likely will be displayed alongside a historical marker from Robinson's birthplace in Cairo, Georgia -- a marker that was damaged by gunfire in 2021 and was donated to the museum.
""We have a story to tell,"" Kendrick said.
The statue, which police said was valued at $75,000, was stolen from McAdams Park, where League 42 plays its games. Police said they don't believe the crime to be racially motivated, based on what they know at this time. Instead, according to police, it's believed that it was ""motivated by the financial gain of scrapping common metal.""
Using surveillance video, police said there were at least three individuals present when the statue was cut, leaving the bronze replicas of Robinson's cleats behind.
On Jan. 28, police recovered a vehicle that it believed to be connected to the case at an apartment complex in Wichita. Two days after that, fire crews found burned remnants of the statue while responding to a trash can fire at another park about 7 miles away.
On Feb. 13, police announced the arrest of Ricky Alderete, 45. He was charged with felony theft (value over $25,000), aggravated criminal damage to property, identity theft and making false information. A Wichita police officer told ESPN that he believes there will be more arrests in the case.
Lutz, a former Wichita newspaper reporter, founded the league a decade ago in a grassroots effort to provide an outlet for kids and to increase local African American participation in the sport. It now has more than 600 players, uses four fields and provides an indoor workout facility with artificial turf, along with after-school tutoring and financial literacy programs.
The statue of Robinson was erected in the park in 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-02-23,"Authorities plan for threats to Republican, Democratic presidential conventions",The confidential DHS analysis lays out potential online and real-world attacks to help law enforcement identify potential threats surrounding the national conventions.,"Months before they’re set to begin, law enforcement is already planning a massive effort to protect the presidential nominating conventions set for this summer, according to a new federal bulletin.
The Republican and Democratic gatherings – the signature gatherings of the 2024 presidential election – would make attractive targets for would-be attackers or anyone else interested in causing disruptions that might embarrass or endanger the events, or worse, in front of massive in-person and television audiences, analysts at the Department of Homeland Security have concluded.
The confidential DHS analysis, obtained by ABC News, lays out a menu of potential online and real-world attacks in an effort to help law enforcement agencies identify ""potential threats"" during the ""build-up and execution"" of the political conventions. With less than six months to go before the Republicans gather in Milwaukee and the Democrats meet in Chicago, law enforcement and security personnel are strategizing and planning, the document says.
The logo for the Democratic National Convention is displayed on the scoreboard at the United Center during a media walkthrough, Jan. 18, 2024, in Chicago.

""Nation-state and non-state threat actors may view these events as an opportunity to influence or disrupt the U.S. political process using hostile or violent disruption tactics on a national media stage,"" according to the Feb.12 DHS bulletin.
Not only are the conventions ""widely publicized,"" the analysis notes, the threat landscape spans far wider than the event sites: from potential cyber attacks, to information warfare, to ""physical threats"" and attempts at inciting violence.
The new assessment comes as the partisan environment seethes with hostility and division, multiple wars are being waged overseas, and law enforcement eyes the risk of political violence ahead of an election unlike any other in modern American history.
""Our current environment is a tinderbox - and you never know which match is going to land and light a fire. So, whether it’s a parade celebrating the Super Bowl – or a major political convention – we don’t know where the threat might come from, or who might do it, but we know it’s coming – so we’ve got to expect the unexpected and prepare for all of it,"" said Elizabeth Neumann, a DHS assistant secretary during the first years of Trump's presidency and now an ABC News contributor.
""The level of preparations for this election are unlike any I've seen in the past, and that’s because the threat level is unlike it’s ever been before – for a variety of reasons,"" said John Cohen, the former intelligence chief at the Department of Homeland Security and now an ABC News contributor. ""We consider this a perfect storm from a threat perspective, because there’s multiple factors contributing to such volatility in the current threat environment.""
In mid-July, the 2024 Republican National Convention will be gaveled into session in the battleground state of Wisconsin, which played a pivotal role in the 2020 loss of then-President Donald Trump. According to the polls, Trump will likely be his party’s nominee once again, and would be declared as such at the Milwaukee event.
A month later, the Democrats will convene on the shores of Lake Michigan in their party’s historic bastion of Chicago, the hometown of former President Barack Obama. It is a city that holds a critical if not always flattering position in the history of presidential elections. Notably, the 1968 Democratic convention in the Windy City deteriorated into violence outside the hall and a near-riot inside as a result of tensions over the Vietnam War and protests over the party’s nomination process.
MORE: The top threats facing the 2024 election
The 2024 race has so far been marked by increasingly toxic rhetoric, and the intermingling of inflammatory campaign trail hyperbole and courtroom theatrics, as Trump faces four criminal trials in which he maintains his innocence. In addition, hate speech, misinformation and disinformation are running rampant on social media and in real life, and rapidly evolving technology remains vulnerable, experts say. Meanwhile, the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine continue on.
""The country is polarized, people are angry, people view those who hold opposing views as the enemy, there is distrust in government institutions, and in particular, in the election process itself. And in some cases, we have seen this anger and distrust of government materializing into violence,"" Cohen said – with foreign adversaries seeking to ""exploit"" contentious wedge issues in America to achieve their own objectives.
""High-profile public figures and elected officials – that makes it an attractive target – and law enforcement has to deal with a broad range of cyber, physical and information operation-related threats,"" Cohen said.
These will be the first national conventions since the COVID-19 pandemic upended 2020’s plans for large in-person nominating events. It will also be the first since the Jan. 6, 2021 attacks at the U.S. Capitol, which grew out of a Trump rally dedicated to his bogus claims that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen.
Now, law enforcement is combating a more diffuse threat spectrum further enabled by the internet and advancement of artificial intelligence – and they’re gaming out how to thwart any would-be attack on this summer’s iconic political conventions.
The confidential bulletin warns to watch out for ""potential cyber threats"" surrounding the conventions, including ""violent extremist, foreign terrorist organization, nation-state or state-sponsored actors, or cybercriminals attempts to disrupt or collect on the event,"" including through ""social engineering"" like phishing attempts. Cyber techniques could also be used to ""disrupt"" communications and command and control infrastructure, the analysis said.
""Physical threats"" also loom over the conventions, the analysis warned. Bad actors could try to pass as authorized ""security partners"" – and possibly attempt to ""purchase, steal or acquire"" explosives meant to target convention sites.
""Attempts to attack U.S. interests,"" though perhaps nowhere near Milwaukee or Chicago, could also be planned ""in conjunction"" with convention events, the bulletin said.
Violent actors could plan to attack ""critical infrastructure"" associated with the convention venues – with potential targets including commercial or government facilities, political campaigns, emergency services, food and agriculture, energy, communications and transportation.
And there are other ways of exploiting the gatherings from outside the arena. Beware of ""increased supply of narcotics or human trafficking activity to regions hosting"" the conventions, the bulletin said.
The analysis also warns of the danger posed by information warfare of cyber actors sowing ""disinformation,"" and foreign adversaries’ messaging and attempts to influence, sway or disrupt elections.
""We’re seeing a security community trying to be agile – for a threat that’s very agile,"" Neumann said.
MORE: It's become more difficult to identify motivations behind mass casualty attacks: DHS
Wisconsin’s House Delegation has asked the federal government for $75 million to cover security costs during each convention – a $25 million bump up from what host cities have typically received.
Security preparations have been long underway for what state and local law enforcement officials believe will be an ""all hands-on deck"" event with little precedent in recent Wisconsin history, the lawmakers wrote in a joint letter last March.
As many as 4,500 additional police officers from multiple agencies could be brought in to meet Milwaukee’s security demands during the week of the convention, Jeff Fleming, Milwaukee’s director of communications, told ABC.
In gaming out security plans for that week, Milwaukee's Democratic Mayor Cavalier Johnson has underscored the range of factors to consider, Fleming said. Input from the Secret Service, drawing insights from their shelved 2020 DNC hosting plans – and, critically, the political climate in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
""It’s not just Jan. 6, you know - we’re also coming out of the George Floyd-related protests, where urban police departments in general had a great deal of exposure to passionate demonstrations,"" Fleming said. ""I think it has been a continuous learning process, for all law enforcement across the country, on best practices in managing demonstrations, and protecting people and property along the way.""
The city plans to designate a protest space near the convention center and a parade route should demonstrators wish to march, Fleming said.
When Chicago law enforcement found out their city would host the DNC, they sprang into prep mode immediately, Chicago Police Department Superintendent Larry Snelling said during a recent speech.
""We started training right away,"" Snelling said. ""We had about a year to prepare. That’s not a lot of time.""
""It’s going to be a massive, high resource security effort – not only at the conventions themselves, but all around them,"" Cohen said. ""What concerns law enforcement officials is, we’re very good at dealing with the threats of yesterday. We’re only learning now how to deal with the threats of today.""",," """"We're going to defeat cancer."""" And if Republicans cannot rally to that", defend this country, help Ukraine and support the humanitarian efforts in Gaza, well, guess what? Just stick with Donald Trump.,,,,,,

While she has campaigned as an anti-abortion presidential contender, she has sought to differentiate herself from the Republican field with a less strict tone on the issue.
Haley, who said she used artificial insemination to have her son, noted that women need to speak with their doctors about their goals and what's best for their family.

""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement.

Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-02-17,Tech giants come together to combat deceptive deepfakes ahead of 2024 elections,"Twenty technology companies, including Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and TikTok vowed to help prevent deceptive uses of AI from interfering with global elections.","Twenty leading technology companies, including Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, TikTok, X, Amazon and Adobe vowed Friday to help prevent deceptive uses of artificial intelligence from interfering with global elections.
In 2024, 4 billion people in over 40 countries around the world are expected to vote. Experts said easily accessible generative AI tools falling in the hands of bad actors could potentially impact those elections and sway votes.
Generative AI tools allow users to create images, videos, or audio from simple text prompts. Some do not have the necessary safeguards in place to prevent users from creating content of politicians or celebrities saying things they've never said or doing things they've never done.

Just last month, a fake robocall impersonating President Joe Biden's voice discouraged individuals from voting in the New Hampshire primary. Taiwan saw its fair share of deepfakes circulating on social media ahead of its presidential election on Jan. 13.
At the Munich Security Conference, these companies announced the ""Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections,"" which is a voluntary agreement with a set of eight specific commitments to deploy technology countering harmful AI content.
""Democracy rests on safe and secure elections,"" said Kent Walker, president of global affairs at Google at the Munich conference. ""Google has been supporting election integrity for years, and today's accord reflects an industry-side commitment against AI-generated election misinformation that erodes trust. We can't let digital abuse threaten AI's generational opportunity to improve our economies, create new jobs, and drive progress in health and science.""

Some of those commitments include detecting the distribution of this content on their platforms along with developing and implementing technology to mitigate risks related to deceptive AI content.
""We are happy to see these companies taking steps to voluntarily rein in what are likely to be some of the worst abuses. Committing to self-police will help, but it's not enough,"" Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president of Public Citizen, a non profit that's been advocating for the legislation of political and explicit deepfakes, said in a press release.
""The AI companies must commit to hold back technology – especially text-to-video – that presents major election risks until there are substantial and adequate safeguards in place to help us avert many potential problems,"" she added.

This comes on the heels of Open AI touting its new text-to-video tool Sora, which is not yet available to the general public and is being tested by safety experts against potential risks.
""This is a constructive step forward. We appreciate the companies involved for stepping up to the plate. Time will tell how effective these steps are and if further action is needed. We all have a role to play in protecting the integrity of our elections and upholding the democratic process, and we welcome this critical step by technology companies,"" said U.S. Senators Mark Warner, D-Va., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., in a joint statement in support for the accord.

As of today, the signatories of the accord are: Adobe, Amazon, Anthropic, Arm, ElevenLabs, Google, IBM, Inflection AI, LinkedIn, McAfee, Meta, Microsoft, Nota, OpenAI, Snap Inc., Stability AI, TikTok, Trend Micro, Truepic, and X.
The companies said they hope they might see more come onboard, as well as encourage governments to take meaningful action to legislate harmful uses of AI.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-02-17,"OpenAI video-generator Sora risks fueling propaganda and bias, experts say",The newly unveiled product makes 60-second videos based on user prompts.,"A sunbathed Dalmatian tiptoes across a windowsill, a Chinese New Year parade engulfs a city street, an archeologist digs up a chair from desert sand.
Videos posted online display these events, but none of them happened. They make up the first publicly available work created by OpenAI's newly unveiled video-generation tool Sora.
Sora composes videos, lasting up to one-minute long, based on user prompts, just as ChatGPT responds to input with written responses and Dall-E offers up images.
The video-generator is currently in use by a group of product testers but is not available to the public, OpenAI said in a statement on Thursday.
MORE: Google joins effort to increase transparency online with new digital standard
These products carry the potential to improve and ease video storytelling, but they could also supercharge internet misinformation and enhance government propaganda, blurring the already-faint line between real and fake content online, experts told ABC News.
AI-generated videos, meanwhile, threaten to reinforce hateful or biased perspectives picked up from the underlying training materials that make their creation possible, they added.
""The clarity of truth we thought we had with recorded photography and video is gone,"" Kristian Hammond, a professor of computer science at Northwestern University who studies AI, told ABC News. ""We've inadvertently built a world of propaganda engines.""
In response to ABC News' request for comment, OpenAI pointed to a webpage that outlines measures taken by the company to prevent abuse of Sora.
""We'll be taking several important safety steps ahead of making Sora available in OpenAI's products,"" the company website says. ""We are working with red teamers  --  domain experts in areas like misinformation, hateful content, and bias  -- who will be adversarially testing the model.""
The company plans to use some safety features already in palace for its image generator Dall-E, the website says, including a tool that polices text prompts to ensure they do not violate rules against ""extreme violence, sexual content, hateful imagery, celebrity likeness, or the IP of others.""

Experts who spoke to ABC News emphasized the difficulty of evaluating a demo product that has yet to be released to the general public. They sounded alarm, however, over the opportunities for misuse of the video generator and the challenges of implementing fully effective safeguards.
""Realistic images of events play into people's assumptions about what's going on in the real world and can be used to deceive people,"" Sam Gregory, executive director of Witness, an advocacy group that aims to ensure the use of video to protect human rights, told ABC News.
The risks posed by AI-generated content have stoked wide concern in recent weeks.
Fake, sexually explicit AI-generated images of pop star Taylor Swift went viral on social media in late January, garnering millions of views. A fake robocall impersonating President Joe Biden's voice discouraged individuals from voting in the New Hampshire primary last month.
Experts commended the steps taken by OpenAI to prohibit abuses of Sora along these lines. They warned though of the product's likely capability to create deep fakes and the difficulty of preventing such videos.
""They can probably put in a filter that says, 'Don't generate any videos with Taylor Swift,' but people will find ways around it,"" Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor at New York University and author of the book ''Rebooting AI,"" told ABC News.
MORE: Meta will label AI-generated images on Instagram and Facebook
Sora, like other generative AI products, is trained on troves of online data, leaving it susceptible to widely reproduced biases, such as racial and gender stereotypes.
""There are biases in society and those biases will be reflected in these systems,"" Hammond said.
In addition to moderating video prompts and the resulting content, OpenAI plans to implement a ""detection classifier"" that can identify when a video has been produced by Sora, the online statement said. The company said it will also include a popular recognized digital tag, which essentially amounts to a digital watermark.
Such precautions drew applause from experts, though they warned that videos could potentially be reproduced or altered as means of removing the labels.
""People will be trying to get around the guardrails put in place,"" Hammond said. ""It's an arms race.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

2024-02-15,French bulldog owners on edge as violent dognapping incidents rise,"Pet owners across the country are becoming prime targets for thieves looking to snatch expensive French bulldogs, law enforcement and pet groups say.","Ali Zacharias said she has such a bond with her French bulldog Onyx that she went to extremes when the 1-year-old pup was snatched last month.
Zacharias told ""Nightline"" that she was completely caught off guard when the dognapper allegedly took Onyx while Zacharias was eating lunch in downtown Los Angeles and put the bulldog in a car. But at that moment, which was caught on camera and went viral, she said she went into guardian mode and chased after the alleged thief.
""I ran in front of the car. I just sort of grab onto the windshield wipers and I just decide to [be] like, 'Hold on, you're not driving anywhere,'"" she said. ""I just didn't expect to be in the fight mode like Indiana Jones.""
Onyx, belonging to Ali Zacharias is still missing.

Zacharias is recovering from injuries after she was flung from the suspect's car. A woman was arrested last week in connection with the dognapping, but Onyx's whereabouts remain a mystery.

ABC News
Her ordeal has become part of a growing list of nightmare stories that many dog owners across the country are fearing as the number of dognappings of expensive French bulldogs has skyrocketed.
The crimes are leaving many dog owners on edge fearing they could be next.
Tom Sharp, the CEO of American Kennel Club Reunite, told ""Nightline"" that owner-reported dognappings to his nonprofit have risen 140% since 2020.
""In 2023, twice as many French bulldogs were reported stolen to us as the next breed,"" Sharp said.
Law enforcement and pet groups say there has been a rise in thefts of French bulldogs across the country.

""Frenchies"" have become more popular among pet owners over the last couple of years. In 2022, they nudged out Labradors to become the country's top favorite breed, according to data from the American Kennel Club.
The dogs have been popular among celebrities and have even become influencers on social media.
Sharp noted that French bulldogs can carry a higher price tag than other breeds.
""So a bulldog puppy can go anywhere from $3,000 to $10,000 to try to buy one. And that's beyond a lot of people's means, yet they still want one,"" he said.
Several factors behind their cost: most female French bulldogs need artificial insemination and cesarean sections to have puppies. And the average litter produces just three pups, which is typically fewer than other breeds.
Law enforcement experts say the pricey pups can fetch top dollar when they're resold or when a ransom is paid by desperate owners.
In 2021, a man shot Lady Gaga's dogwalker and stole two of her French bulldogs in Los Angeles. James Howard Jackson pleaded guilty a year later and was sentenced to 21 years in prison.
The dogwalker survived the shooting nad has been recuperating from his injuries. The dogs were returned to Lady Gaga.
Teffiney Worthy of Washington, D.C., recalled the terror she faced last November when a man holding a Taser demanded she give up her Frenchie, Hendrix.
Hendrix, Teffiney Worthy's dog is home safe.
Teffiney Worthy
""He left on his way down the stairs and put [Hendrix], in the backseat,"" Worthy told ""Nightline."" ""He was just laughing and drove away.""
Worthy turned to social media for help and, two days later, she received a message on Instagram from a woman who claimed she bought Hendrix for $900.

Sharp said there are steps that Frenchie owners can take to protect themselves, including getting a microchip for their pets that contain the owner's information and not taking them outside without strict supervision.

He emphasized that owners should also be wary about the information they put on social media about their dogs.

Advertising executive and marketing expert Donny Deutsch joined ""Good Morning America"" Monday morning to reveal both favorites and flops, sharing what went into the best ads of the night.
""I thought by far the best ones were the DunKings -- you had monster celebrities -- Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Tom Brady and J. Lo,"" the ""On Brand"" podcast host said. ""I thought Matt Damon actually stole that ad. He was so low key, pitch perfect.""

2024-02-10,What to know about landmark AI regulations proposed in California,A proposed bill aims to address potential extreme risks posed by the technology.,"Sweeping advances in artificial intelligence have elicited warnings from industry leaders about the potential for grave risks, including weapon systems going rogue and massive cyberattacks.
A state legislator in California, home to many of the largest AI companies, proposed a landmark bill this week that would impose regulations to address those dangers.
The bill requires mandatory testing for wide-reaching AI products before they reach users. Every major AI model, the bill adds, should be equipped with a means for shutting the technology down if something goes wrong.
""When we're talking about safety risks related to extreme hazards, it's far preferable to put protections in place before those risks occur as opposed to trying to play catch up,"" state Sen. Scott Wiener, the sponsor of the bill, told ABC News. ""Let's get ahead of this.""
MORE: Dispute over threat of extinction posed by artificial intelligence looms over surging industry
Here's what to know about what the bill does and how it could impact AI regulation nationwide:
What would the bill do to police the risks of AI?
The bill would heighten the scrutiny faced by large AI models before they gain wide option, ensuring that state officials test the products prior to their release.
In addition to mandating an emergency off-switch, the bill would implement hacking protections to make AI less vulnerable to bad actors.
To bolster enforcement, the measure would establish the Frontier Model Division within the California Department of Technology as a means of carrying out the regulations.
Since the legislation focuses on extreme risks, it will not apply to small-scale AI products, Wiener said.
""Our goal is to foster innovation with safety in mind,"" Wiener added.
Even more, the bill would promote AI development by creating CalCompute, a publicly owned initiative that would facilitate shared computing power among businesses, researchers and community groups.

The effort would help lower the technical threshold for small firms or organizations that may lack the immense computing capacity enjoyed by large companies, Teri Olle, the director of nonprofit Economic Security California, told ABC News.
""By expanding that access, it will allow for there to be research and innovation and AI development that is aligned with the public interest,"" said Olle, whose organization helped develop this feature of the bill.
Sarah Myers West, managing director of AI Now Institute, a nonprofit group that supports AI regulation, applauded the preventative approach taken by the measure.
""It's great to see the focus on addressing and mitigating harms before they go into the market,"" Myers West told ABC News.
However, she added, many current risks posed by AI remain unaddressed, including bias in algorithms used to set worker pay or grant access to healthcare.
""There are so many places where AI is already being used to affect people,"" Myers West said.
For his part, Wiener said the California legislature has taken up other bills to address some of the ongoing harms caused by AI. ""We're not going to solve every problem in one bill,"" Wiener added.

How could the bill impact AI legislation nationwide?
The California measure on extreme AI risk comes amid a surge of AI-related bills in statehouses nationwide.
As of September, state legislatures had introduced 191 AI-related bills in 2023, amounting to a 440% increase over the full previous year, according to BSA the Software Alliance, an industry group.
Legislation proposed in California carries special weight, however, since many of the largest AI companies are based in the state, said Olle, of Economic Security California.
""Regulations in California set the standard,"" Olle said. ""In complying with these standards in California, you affect the market.""
Despite recent policy discussion and hearings, Congress has achieved little progress toward a comprehensive measure to address AI risks, Myers West said.
""Congress has been kind of stuck,"" Myers West added. ""That does mean there's a really important role for the states.""
MORE: Meta will label AI-generated images on Instagram and Facebook
Dylan Hoffman, executive director for California and the Southwest at industry lobbying group TechNet, emphasized the importance of U.S.-based AI regulation that shapes global rules surrounding the technology.
""America must set the standards for the responsible development and deployment of AI for the world,"" Hoffman told ABC News in a statement. ""We look forward to reviewing the legislation and working with Senator Wiener to ensure any AI policies benefit all Californians, address any risks, and strengthen our global competitiveness.""
While crafting the bill, Wiener borrowed some concepts from an executive order issued by President Joe Biden in October, such as the threshold used to determine whether an AI model reaches a large enough scale to warrant regulation, Wiener said.
Still, Wiener said he remains skeptical of the likelihood for federal legislation that would mimic the approach taken by the California bill.
""I would love for Congress to pass a strong, pro-innovation pro-safety AI law,"" Wiener added. ""I don't have extreme confidence that Congress will be able to do anything in the near future. I hope they prove me wrong.""",, as if this was some sort of, like, high school debate, open forum, repeating back the words that she was saying to him, challenging him on that, and that's where he, sort of," caught himself in this bind when it came to using the term """"illegal", which obviously drew a lot of backlash from Democrats, and now the president has -- has backtracked on that.
2024-02-10,New California bill aims to implement AI transparency,"California state Sen. Josh Becker introduces legislation that will require AI providers to watermark their images, videos and audio.","Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,"McCaffrey, Bosa 'not happy' after 6 a.m. fire alarm at 49ers hotel",요약 없음,"HENDERSON, Nev. -- Seven minutes before George Kittle's 6:10 a.m. alarm was set to go off, he and the rest of his San Francisco 49ers teammates were jarred awake by something else: the fire alarm at the team's hotel on the outskirts of Las Vegas.
Kittle jumped out of bed, walked into his bathroom, closed the door and waited there for the next 18 minutes until the noise stopped. Nobody was forced to evacuate as engineers at the hotel said it was a false alarm.
But not every Niner was quite as nonplussed by the disturbance as Kittle. When he walked down to breakfast, he took an informal poll among his teammates to see who was the grumpiest because of the early wake-up call.
The answer: a tie between running back Christian McCaffrey and defensive end Nick Bosa, both of whom are notorious in San Francisco's locker room for their devotion to routine.
""It had to be them,"" Kittle said. ""You don't want to wake the sleeping bear. But Christian was not happy too.""
Indeed, McCaffrey and Bosa were both still at least slightly agitated about it Thursday afternoon when they met with the media for the final time before Sunday's Super Bowl LVIII against the Kansas City Chiefs.
During his availability, McCaffrey made it clear he didn't believe the alarm was set off by accident.
""I think there's no way it's random,"" McCaffrey said. ""It's part of it. It's just more wood thrown on the fire.""
Like Kittle, Bosa was asleep when the alarm went off. He woke up and immediately texted the rest of the defensive line group chat, which he said was already full of complaints for the premature and loud wake up.
While Bosa took some solace in the fact that it was relatively close to a normal wake up time instead of 2 or 3 a.m., he agreed with McCaffrey that it was unlikely an accident and noted that this isn't the first time the Niners or any other team has dealt with some hotel shenanigans on the road.
""I'm sure somebody did it,"" Bosa said. ""It kind of reminded me of Philly when they had this construction going on outside. It was early in the morning and they were like demolishing a bridge right outside of our hotel. We haven't had the best luck. But no excuses.""
The fire alarm was the latest wrench thrown in what's already been something of a trying run up to Sunday for the Niners. They have been and remain unhappy about the condition of the practice fields they have used at UNLV this week.
Niners officials, coaches and players have noted that the surface, which is sod laid over an artificial surface, is much softer than what is standard. Niners coach Kyle Shanahan said Wednesday that the team ""will deal with the field how it is,"" which is why the team has not changed its practice schedule this week to move to a different practice setup.
The 49ers have one more workout at UNLV on Friday to wrap up the practice week.
""We're just trying to get to Sunday and be as prepared as we possibly can,"" Bosa said. ""And if we have to deal with a couple more issues, we're ready to do it.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

As examples of AI-generated content continue to make headlines -- from fake sexually explicit AI images of Taylor Swift, to a deceptive AI-generated voice clone of President Biden -- the need for clarity around what we are seeing online seems more urgent.
""The danger of deepfakes isn't the deception it's the doubt because once you doubt everything, then you don't believe anything,"" said Dana Rao, Adobe's general counsel and chief trust officer, in an interview with ABC News. ""And so that's why we always like provenance.""

MORE: Amid spread of AI tools, new digital standard would help users tell fact from fiction
Since its creation in 2021, the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) has been working toward creating an open technical standard providing publishers, creators, and consumers the ability to trace the origin of different types of media.
The C2PA says its developed those solutions and now, with Google backing the effort, there's belief widespread adoption might be around the corner.

Content credentials -- often described as a ""nutrition label"" for digital content -- are tamper-resistant and allow the metadata to be attached to digital content, showing how and when the content was created and modified.
""It's like an evidence bag,"" C2PA Chair Andrew Jenks told ABC News. ""When a police officer goes to a crime scene and picks up a piece of evidence and puts it in a bag, he signs and seals that bag. When it arrives to in the courtroom, you can look back at the record and see every place the evidence has been""
This ""nutrition label,"" if adopted by social media platforms and publishers, could be displayed on every piece of content hosted online allowing users to access the history of any piece of content.
Google will now be a member on the C2PA steering committee, joining Adobe, Microsoft, Intel, Truepic and other companies helping set the technical direction and focus of the group.
Richardson said there isn't anything specific to share in terms of how Google will implement the technology across its products, but she's hopeful that they will have more to share in the coming months. With upcoming elections around the world, there is an ""urgency"" in making sure that Google is helping shape an ""ecosystem wide solution, said Richardson.

They had no way of knowing then just how desperate those calls would grow in the hours to come on that day six months ago, Aug. 8, 2023 -- or how many there would be.
""We thought it was just going to be a normal fire, maybe evacuate a few houses, a few streets,"" Pupunu told ABC News. ""But, yeah, it was not like that at all.""

Fueled by ferocious gusts from a Pacific hurricane, wildfires developed in four different Maui locations that day. The hardest hit – Lahaina: the blaze ravaged the community, killing 100 people. All told, the fires burned more than 6,600 acres and left thousands of homes and other structures in ruins. It would quickly rank as the worst natural disaster in Hawaii history, officials say, and America's deadliest wildfire in over a century.
The Hawaiian word for ""guardian"" or ""protector"" is kia'i. When a fire breaks out, firefighters are first to get the call to respond. But police are close behind: they are responsible for rescuing and evacuating the community -- tasks that are infinitely more difficult on a remote island.

A look at Maui 6 months after the fires The Maui Police Department released an after-action report detailing its response to the Maui wildfires amid public criticism of its actions that day. ABC News’ Mola Lenghi reports.
ABCNews.com
The Maui Police Department Monday released the results of a preliminary after-action investigation into how its officers and staff acted and reacted in response to the Aug. 8 fires. Every officer and dispatcher connected to the fire response was interviewed as part of the probe.
To coincide with the release of their report, Maui police agreed to give ABC News exclusive access to the officers who responded to the blazes, as well as police leaders. They shared a harrowing story of how their understaffed department responded on the day flames of mythic proportions ripped through paradise.
Maui was already under a ""red flag"" warning on Aug. 8, meaning the powerful hurricane winds could create the risk of ""extreme fire"" on an island covered by dry fields -- and serviced by an aging electrical system.
When first responders sprang into action, they were confronted by a perfect storm of circumstances, investigators determined.
Maui Police Chief John Pelletier.

""We had multiple catastrophic, dynamic, rapidly evolving fires that were ripping this island apart,"" Maui Police Chief John Pelletier said.
As one blaze was contained, another seemed to start. The winds fueled a fire in Lahaina that made it impossible to see, collapsed communications systems, downed power lines and rendered evacuation routes nearly useless, according to a report released by the Maui Police Department this week.
Despite the red flag warnings, Hawaiian Electric did not preemptively shut off the power, according to the utility's CEO, Shelee Kimura. The company told ABC News that it, ""like many utilities,"" does not have ""a power shut-off program"" and that ""preemptive, short-notice power shutoffs have to be coordinated with first responders,"" and ""in Lahaina, electricity powers the pumps that provide the water needed for firefighting."" Kimura said a fire at 6:30 a.m. was likely caused by power lines that fell in high winds.

The early-morning fire in Lahaina was ""wrapped in a dozer line,"" which is when responders clear away the brush, creating a break, and ""contained,"" Fire Chief Brad Ventura said, with resources on it for over five hours. Firefighters left the scene shortly after 2 p.m. to battle fires elsewhere on the island. An hour later, a fire was once again burning in the same area above Lahaina on the island's northwestern coast.
As fierce gusts barreled across West Maui, flames raged down the mountainside, and emergency dispatch, run by the police department, began to get flooded with calls for help from Lahaina, dispatcher Melia Johnson recalled. Call volume quickly overwhelmed a thinly staffed workforce, MPD's report said.
As police juggled citizens' frantic evacuations, redirecting traffic away from hazards -- even as their own families were forced to flee -- some officers were unable to contact their families, and, at first, some went without proper protective gear, the report said.
Wind and flames quickly tore through utility poles and cables, leaving Lahaina without cellular or Wi-Fi capacity, and fallen poles began to block the roads.
Suspended cables and downed high-voltage electrical wires were ""spiderwebbed"" and strewn across roadways -- cutting off what could have been the few critical routes for escape, the report said. And in hardest-hit Lahaina, that was particularly perilous: A single highway offers the ""only major road"" through the area, the ""primary route for transportation and logistics"" on an island, where rescue and evacuation are already ""extremely challenging,"" Pelletier said.
Lahaina was already ""engulfed"" by the time officers Pupunu and Dawn made it in, Pupunu said. He said he realized then that he might never see some of his friends or family again.

Faced with the inferno, Dawn says he powered on his body camera.
""I actually said something like, 'At least we'll get our last moments on video,'"" he said. ""I was like, 'You know, if I get out of this car, I'm probably not going to get back in the car. And if I do get back in the car, I probably won't be able to drive out.'""
Nearing the heart of the hellish blaze -- where it was nearly impossible to open their eyes -- Dawn said they suddenly noticed a flashing light from inside a coffee shop. It was from a cell phone waved by one of more than a dozen people trapped inside.
The officers packed their Ford Explorer and a nearby fire truck with the rescued, still unsure whether they could make it. The road out was narrow, the winds whipping up flames, thick smoke and sharp debris and sheet metal torn from buildings. They were forced to offroad their escape, through grass and over barriers, Dawn said. They eventually made it.
""We just stopped; we took everybody out of our car, and we just went right back into right where we came from,"" Dawn said. ""We went directly back on the road we had just come out of, and it was completely impassable at that point. So, if we were five minutes off-- not even five minutes, we were two minutes off, we would have died, 100%.""
Downed power lines became what officers feared was an electrified minefield in the fires, cutting off would-be escape routes. In the chaos, some residents said it seemed to them that the police were inexplicably trying to keep people from escaping. The police investigation concluded that some roads were closed not to trap motorists but to protect them from dangers at other locations or intersections that they could not see.
Although Hawaiian Electric's Kimura said all the company's lines in West Maui had been de-energized for hours by the time a second fire broke out in the same area, Maui's police chief said that didn't remove the potential danger.
""De-energized is not grounded. A de-energized line can still kill you,"" Pelletier said.
""There's some roads that no matter what you did, you couldn't go through. As far as you could see, every single power pole was down,"" Officer Rahul Mehra said.
His own house burned that day.
""We didn't have any information regarding if the wires were hot,"" Mehra said. ""So, we didn't know if you could drive over it.""

Flames were advancing fast and unpredictably, jumping over highways that were already hard to reach, tearing through neighborhood after neighborhood, from the mountains to the ocean.
The fires also spread faster than good information could: in a crisis when accurate communication is vital, it was stymied by the very elements that had conspired to cause the natural disaster, according to the report.

In the high winds, ""drones and aircraft were unable to assist"" with the chaos and ""unable to be deployed,"" according to the report. The Lahaina area was ""hit with a complete failure of commercial electrical service,"" the report said, leaving police to communicate only on two-way radios.
But as near-80 mph winds made it impossible to hear what was being said on their radios -- and for a police force that did not have earpieces -- it ""led to some misunderstandings of radio transmissions,"" the report said. With officers ""actively engaged in evacuations"" and the ""sheer number"" of circumstances before them, it was ""apparent that officers may have missed certain transmissions,"" according to the MPD report.
As the fire's rampage worsened, officers tried to manage ""gridlocked"" traffic on ""key streets"" to alleviate congestion so people could escape Lahaina, the report said. Police used loudspeakers to evacuate residents amid the ""rapid spread of the fire and reduced visibility.""
The fire's push toward the Lahaina Civic Center prompted more than a thousand people to evacuate, ""many without vehicles,"" the report said -- and from the onset of Lahaina's fire and ""into the morning"" of Aug. 9, police and fire personnel ""transported hundreds of citizens"" within their emergency vehicles out of harm's way, according to the report.
It felt like a scene out of an ""apocalyptic type movie,"" said Officer Kenny Carroll, a 20-year veteran of the Maui police. ""The winds kept changing, and everything kept changing. So, your plan might've been good five minutes ago. But with the change of the winds and the fire and stuff, now it's not an option.""
Finding other ways out meant improvising for police, the report said: One officer worked with a civilian and county employee ""to unlock a series of gates and lead evacuees down a dirt road, creating a vital escape path for vehicles."" Another officer ""utilized his own straps to tie to a fence and his police vehicle to pull a fence down,"" according to the report.
Carroll thought he had an exit route for trapped residents, but as he approached the gate, he realized others were stuck on the other side, also trying to flee. He attached his tow strap to the gate, yanking it open by force.
""Usually, when we train and we plan, we're getting ready for a bad guy or some type of threat of that nature,"" Carroll said. ""Never Mother Nature.""
Once the fires abated, the momentum of misinformation gathered speed with a different type of ferocity: a toxic haze of false information was spread in the chaotic aftermath and, the report said, fed confusion. Grief and blame turned toward the officers who had tried to help people escape.
""They're trying to say that we trapped people and we wanted their houses to burn so that people can come and buy them,"" Officer Teanu Rickard said. ""Why would I burn my own house, my families' houses? For what? So I can do what? Like, it makes no sense.""
That criticism is based on a ""false narrative,"" Pelletier said, explaining what investigators found.
""People are upset. And they haven't even, like, started grieving for the most part. They need someone to blame,"" Mehra said. ""And whoever they can find blame on to make themselves feel better at the time, yes. But after they're done grieving or in the process, they're gonna realize, hey, these are our people from the community. They lost their homes, too.""
Officials now believe the impetus behind that storm of false information might have been more malicious, revealing they are investigating potential foreign involvement in creating and disseminating some social media posts that fed the false information.
(MORE: Maui wildfire missed signals stoke outrage as officials point fingers)
In September, Brad Smith, vice chairman and president of Microsoft Corp., testified before Congress that ""people who regularly spread Russian propaganda"" were ""trying to discourage the people of Lahaina from going to the agencies that could help them. That's inexcusable.""
""And we saw what we believe is Chinese-directed activity, trying to persuade the world in multiple languages that the fire was caused by the United States government itself using a meteorological weapon,"" Smith added.
Disinformation, experts say, is now a sinister and burgeoning type of warfare posing a secondary attack in the wake of disaster.
In the aftermath, as families were desperate for answers, the community stood in shock and the nation watched in horror, as misinformation and disinformation spread, the police report found.
MPD investigators' report found artificial intelligence was ""used to spread disinformation and undermine trust in the government,"" feeding confusion.
""There was evidence of a concentrated effort, including some by foreign governments, as well as lone wolf actors, to disrupt the integrity of first responders, the community and government,"" the report said.
""We're actually seeing that during these major emergencies, terror groups, foreign intelligence services, domestic violent extremists, criminals will use cyber-attacks and information warfare in an effort to create confusion and chaos, to seed distrust of government, to cause fear amongst the populace, even inspire violence,"" said John Cohen, the former intelligence chief at the Department of Homeland Security and now an ABC News contributor. ""Their goal is to disrupt the response. Their goal is to sow discord.""
A memorandum later found to be bogus and purporting to have been authored by FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell was ""sent to public and private entities hidden under a @proton.me email account,"" the report said, and claimed to highlight ""grave concerns"" about the ""handling"" of the wildfire disaster, and ""reveals serious lapses by local authorities, potential assumption of federal control and ongoing criminal investigations."" The fact that the memo was fake didn't mitigate the damage it did, the MPD report said.
During the process of notifying families of the dead or injured, the report said, that undermined trust posed a ""challenge.""
""Some of the families were uneasy with trusting government agencies as they were seeing and hearing conspiracies online, by word of mouth and in the media,"" the report said, and some were ""hesitant to give DNA samples to help identify family members if remains were recovered.""
Now, Pelletier is bent on rebuilding not only his department but also his community.
""It is very much like losing a leg,"" he said. ""But I can tell you this, that even though you lose a leg, you can, you can, with a prosthetic, learn to stand again, learn to walk again and learn to run again. And our finest days are not behind us. They're very much in front of us.""

날짜 없음,NFLPA's Howell says 92% of players want grass fields over turf,요약 없음,"LAS VEGAS -- A vast majority of players in the union want to play on natural grass fields, NFLPA executive director Lloyd Howell said Tuesday, adding that there is a certain ""hypocrisy"" with some NFL stadiums agreeing to adhere to FIFA regulations by installing grass for upcoming soccer matches in the 2026 World Cup but reverting to artificial turf for football games.
""It's really basic,"" Howell said Wednesday in an NFLPA news conference at the Mandalay Bay resort. ""It's not rocket science. Ninety-two percent of our union wants grass. That's compelling. The bottom line is, it's unquestionable that our union wants to have a working condition where they play on grass.""
Howell said data collected by the union showed injuries occurring on a slower rate on natural grass fields, as opposed to artificial turf.
Four players on the NFLPA's executive committee -- Atlanta Falcons defensive end Calais Campbell, Jacksonville Jaguars placekicker Brandon McManus, former Cincinnati Bengals safety Michael Thomas and Los Angeles Chargers running back Austin Ekeler -- concurred. Ekeler talked about how much ""turf tape"" he has to wear on his forearms when playing on synthetic grass because of the burns he accumulates.
""You bounce a little bit different off concrete, rubber and plastic than you do off grass and dirt,"" Ekeler laughed. ""It hurts. Turf is a lot harder surface.
""When it comes to my legs, on turf, you stick. On grass, dirt, you move a little bit. So, it's the accumulation of those little things.""
Thomas said simply practicing on turf during the week leaves players feeling more sore heading into the game, leading to tighter hamstrings and more ""wear and tear"" on the body.
""We've got to fix it,"" said Campbell, a 16-year veteran.
NFLPA president JC Tretter compared injury trends.
""Turf has stayed relatively consistent at an injury rate over the last decade,"" Tretter said. ""Grass this year has its highest injury rate over the last decade, but it was still lower than the injury rate on turf. So, the worst performing year on grass is still better than turf this year.""
Said Howell: ""Today, 13 fields are grass, the balance a version of synthetic turf. Yes, there is movement afoot to identify the highest consistent playing surface. But at the end of the day, our players' preference is grass and that should matter.""
With seven NFL stadiums being used for World Cup play switching to grass -- Gillette Stadium, MetLife Stadium, Lumen Field, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, AT&T Stadium, NRG Stadium, SoFi Stadium -- Howell saw a path.
""There's a model out there that says, for another sport it's possible,"" Howell said. ""Now certainly the average football player, the football game is different than soccer. We appreciate that. But the science alone says this is possible.
""And so, when we have engaged the league, we've actually had a very rational conversation. We've looked at the data, we've looked at, is there a material difference? And at any given point in time, depending on the timeline ... yeah. [It could extend a] guy's career by two or three years and that's meaningful to our union and that's dollars to them and their families, their lives. That's a difference in chronic pain for the rest of their lives. So, this extends way beyond the aesthetics of us as fans watching the game. This is really a workplace issue for our players.""
Issues with 49ers' Super Bowl practice field
Howell and Tretter also took umbrage with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell saying the San Francisco 49ers' practice field at UNLV, where grass was put on top of the Rebels' artificial practice field and decried as being too soft by the team, was ""playable"" earlier in the week.
""When you're putting a grass sod field over existing turf, you would put a hard plastic cover over the turf before putting the sod down,"" Tretter said. ""My understanding is that's not what happened. ... I don't know how that doesn't happen.
""'Playable' is not the same thing as high quality. So, we can't kind of talk out of both sides of our mouth on this.""
Players not in favor of banning hip-drop tackle
While players were not exactly fans of the hip-drop tackle, which can lead to serious injury, they were not necessarily against banning it.
""I don't understand how you can police it the right way and allow us to do our job,"" Campbell said. ""At the end of the day, it's like, how do you tackle a guy?
""This is definitely a big issue. I know the whole point is to make the game safer, right? And keep guys on the field ... but at the same time, there's only so much you can restrict the game and still call it football. ... I don't think taking it out of the game is going to work.""
On the gambling ban for Chiefs and 49ers ending after Super Bowl
""It only makes common sense that when the business of football is done, that the guys have the opportunity to partake of what Las Vegas has to offer,"" Howell said. ""So, you may have seen policy change to that effect, which we're happy certainly to make. It's common sense.""
Campbell was not a fan of the NFL banning gambling outside of football, calling the rules ""outdated.""
""There was a time when it made sense,"" he said. ""But now, with technology, and being able to bet on your phone, change can come pretty fast.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-02-07,Meta will label AI-generated images on Instagram and Facebook,"Meta will label AI-generated images on Instagram and Facebook; ""I hope this is a big step forward,"" a Meta executive told ""GMA.""","Meta will begin labeling images created by OpenAI, Midjourney and other artificial intelligence products, Nick Clegg, the company's president of global affairs, announced in an interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday.
The labels, set to roll out in the coming months, will identify AI-generated images posted on Facebook, Instagram and Threads, Clegg said. Images created by a Meta's own tool will also be labeled, Clegg added.
""I hope this is a big step forward in trying to make sure that people know what they're looking at, and they know where what they're looking at comes from,"" Clegg told GMA. ""As the difference between human and synthetic content gets blurred, people want to know where the boundary lies.""
The labels, however, will not be a ""perfect solution,"" Clegg acknowledged, citing the scale and complexity of AI-generated content on the platforms.
MORE: Fake explicit Taylor Swift images: White House is 'alarmed'
Meta cannot currently identify AI-generated audio and video produced using outside tech platforms, Clegg said in a blog post on Tuesday. To address this issue, Meta will add a feature that allows users to voluntarily label audio or video as AI-generated when they upload it to a platform, Clegg said.
The risks posed by AI-generated content have stoked wide concern in recent weeks.
Fake, sexually explicit AI-generated images of pop star Taylor Swift went viral on social media late last month, garnering millions of views. In response, the White House called on Congress and tech firms to take action.
""While social media companies make their own independent decisions about content management, we believe they have an important role to play in enforcing their own rules to prevent the spread of misinformation, and non-consensual, intimate imagery of real people,"" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told ABC News White House correspondent Karen Travers.
Another incident last month drew attention to election risks posed by AI. A fake robocall impersonating President Joe Biden's voice discouraged individuals from voting in the New Hampshire Primary.
As Americans head to the polls in 2024, tech companies should take action to assure users that they will be able to identify whether or not online content is authentic, Clegg said.

""In an election year like this, it's incumbent upon us as an industry to make sure we do as much as the technology allows to provide as much visibility to people so they can distinguish between what's synthetic and what's not synthetic,"" Clegg added.
In September, a bipartisan group of senators proposed a bill that would ban the use of deceptive AI content falsely portraying candidates for federal office in political ads.
When asked whether Meta supports the bill, Clegg said he backs legislation regulating AI but did not specifically comment on the Senate measure.
""I think it's right that you have certain guardrails in place to make sure that there's proper transparency about how these big AI models are built, to make sure that they're properly stress tested so they're as safe as they can be,"" Clegg said. ""Yes, I think there's definitely a role for governments.""

Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",, but Joe Biden...,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,"49ers to 'deal with' soft practice field, won't alter schedule",요약 없음,"LAS VEGAS -- The San Francisco 49ers held their first on-field activity of the week at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas on Monday. It won't be their last.
According to players, the surface was a little bit soft as they went through their walk-through, but 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said at Super Bowl opening night that the team does not intend to alter where or how it will practice this week.
""It is what it is,"" Shanahan said. ""We'll be all right. It's the field we got. We're good.""
Earlier Monday morning, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter that members of the Niners organization did not care for the playing surface at UNLV. In anticipation of the 49ers using the fields this week, the NFL installed a sod field on top of the current field turf surface. Sources told Schefter that the sod field was installed just last week though the NFL normally requires Super Bowl practice fields to meet certain standards in December and that the NFL hardness score for fields averages 78 with no field's score being less than 70. The Niners' field for the week landed somewhere in the 50s.
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell disagreed with the notion that the fields were not up to standard during his Super Bowl news conference Monday.
""That work is being done every single day,"" Goodell said. ""We've had 23 experts out there. We've had the union out there. All of them think it's a very playable surface. It's softer than what they have practiced on, but that happens. It's well within all of our testing standards. It is something that we think all our experts, as well as neutral field inspectors, have all said, unanimously, that it's a playable field.""
The 49ers are scheduled to practice at UNLV on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday afternoon before meeting the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII.
The Chiefs are using the Las Vegas Raiders' practice facility in Henderson, Nevada, this week. One of the factors in the Niners' decision to continue at UNLV was a reluctance to change the team's schedule in order to go elsewhere. Shanahan has been adamant about maintaining a routine as the team installed the game plan last week during the bye and is planning to fine-tune it this week.
""We're not going to completely change our schedule and do something crazy,"" Shanahan said. ""We'll deal with what we got.""
Multiple 49ers players noted Monday night that the playing surface at UNLV felt ""a little soft"" during the walk-through. Players such as end Nick Bosa and tight end George Kittle have been outspoken proponents of player safety when it comes to the surfaces, but that has generally been aimed at stadiums with artificial turf.
This is the second consecutive year that a Super Bowl or Super Bowl-related playing surface has come under the microscope. It was a storyline after last year's Super Bowl in Glendale, Arizona, when a slick field caused footing problems for the Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles. The field at Allegiant Stadium for Sunday's matchup is a sod surface that will be rolled in from outside before the game.
Despite their displeasure with the UNLV fields, the 49ers didn't want to make it more of an issue on Monday night, noting that practice and the game are two different things.
""We're not playing on it, so we're not tripping,"" cornerback Charvarius Ward said. ""I'm not concerned at all. I can run full speed at any surface. I played football on the street as a kid.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-02-06,Maui police release 1st report after investigation into response to deadly blazes,The Maui Police Department released its after-action investigation report on Monday.,"It was a perfect storm that confronted first responders when wildfires broke out on the Hawaiian island of Maui in August, investigators have determined.
""Severe weather"" fed the flames, investigators say, and many of the already limited roads became impassable. An already understaffed police force was left to grapple with communications and equipment problems that hadn't previously been anticipated, a preliminary after-action investigation has found.
Those are some of the findings of the probe, released Monday by the Maui Police Department. It's the first analysis performed by any of the island's emergency response agencies since wildfires destroyed the historic Lahaina district of the island on Aug. 8, 2023, ultimately, according to the report, killing 100 people, burning more than 6,600 acres, and leaving thousands of homes and other structures in ruins. The wind-fed blaze stands as what state officials said was the worst natural disaster in Hawaii's history and America's deadliest wildfire in over a century, the fifth deadliest in U.S. history.
""In policing, we respond to dynamic and evolving situations,"" Maui Police Chief John Pelletier wrote in the report released Monday. ""We cannot control the incidents we respond to; we can, however, control our responses in the aftermath.""
Aftermath of the wildfires in the Maui neighborhood of Lahaina last August.

At a press briefing Monday evening, Pelletier led the room in 100 seconds of silence ""to honor those we lost.""
""If it seems like that was long, realize this: for the families, the pain never ends, and the silence is deafening,"" Pelletier said.
The 98-page document paints a picture of chaos on Maui as winds from a Pacific hurricane fueled a series of fires that started throughout Aug. 8 in four different locations on the 727-square-mile island. As one blaze was contained, another seemed to start. Then finally, with the ferocity of the gales of Hawaiian legend, the winds fueled a fire in Lahaina that made it impossible to see, collapsed communications systems, downed power lines and rendered evacuation routes nearly useless, according to the report.
It wasn't just the thick smoke and rapidly spreading flames, investigators found, that made Maui officers' jobs -- and citizens' survival -- harder: A toxic haze of false information lingered in the chaos, and, the report said, fed confusion.
The police after-action review was led by Sgt. Chase Bell, who was assigned to the investigation by the chief and who interviewed every single officer and police department staffer connected to the department's response. He said the report was to determine what was done wrong, what was done right and what needed to be done in the future for the island's police force to be better prepared for the next natural disaster.

Among the report's findings are:
As police juggled citizens' frantic evacuations, redirecting traffic away from hazards -- even as their own families were forced to flee, some officers were unable to contact their families and, at first, some went without proper protective gear.
Emergency dispatch for the island, which is run by the police department, was quickly overwhelmed by a call volume that staffers could not handle.
Wind and flames quickly tore through utility poles and cables, leaving Lahaina without cellular or Wi-Fi capacity.
Fractured and fallen utility poles blocked the roads as gusts barreled across the island. Suspended cables and downed high-voltage electrical wires were ""spiderwebbed"" and strewn across roadways -- cutting off what could have been the few critical routes for escape. In hardest-hit Lahaina, that was particularly perilous: A single highway offers the ""only major road"" through the area, the ""primary route for transportation and logistics.""

Despite the red flag warnings of dangerously high winds days ahead of Aug. 8, Hawaiian Electric did not preemptively shut off the power, the utility's CEO, Shelee Kimura, testified in September, with the company telling ABC News that they, ""like many utilities, do not have a power shut-off program;"" that ""preemptive, short-notice power shutoffs have to be coordinated with first responders,"" and ""in Lahaina, electricity powers the pumps that provide the water needed for firefighting."" According to Kimura, a fire at 6:30 a.m. was likely caused by power lines that fell in high winds.
The police investigation didn't address the utility's potential culpability for the fires, the origin of the blazes or the response by fire crews. The examination dealt exclusively with the actions of the Maui Police Department, which, in the case of fire, plays a secondary role, assisting with evacuations, communications and rescue efforts.
""Life safety is always our primary priority when responding to any incident, and especially in the incident, in an incident of this magnitude. Our officers' efforts remain focused on this, whether it was by conducting evacuations, the facilitation of emergency traffic getting out, as well as the transport of individuals,"" Bell said at Monday’s briefing. ""As we all have come to know, this is an unprecedented, prolonged, constantly evolving and wildly dynamic event.""

A fire broke out in Lahaina during the early morning hours of Aug. 8 but was 90% contained by 8:19 a.m., according to the police timeline. Just over five hours later, the winds were kicking up in that same area, and power lines were coming down. By 2:55 pm, a caller reported smoke and fire spreading fast in the area of Kuialua Street and Hookahua Street, according to police. Sixteen more calls would come in within three minutes, police said.
As the fire's rampage worsened, officers tried to manage ""gridlocked"" traffic on ""key streets"" to alleviate congestion so people could escape the famous enclave in the northwestern part of Maui, according to the report. Police used their loudspeakers to try and direct residents even as the ""rapid spread of the fire and reduced visibility"" made evacuation ""challenging,"" the report said.
The fire's spread toward the Lahaina Civic Center prompted more than a thousand people to evacuate, ""many without vehicles,"" the report said -- and from the onset of Lahaina's fire and ""into the morning"" of Aug. 9, police and fire personnel ""transported hundreds of citizens"" within their own emergency vehicles out of harm's way, according to the report.

Finding other ways meant improvising for police, the report said: One officer worked with a civilian and county employee ""to unlock a series of gates and lead evacuees down a dirt road, creating a vital escape path for vehicles."" Another officer ""utilized his own straps to tie to a fence and his police vehicle to pull a fence down,"" according to the report.
As the fires began and police worked to get people out of their path, ""not all officers had proper [personal protective equipment], especially relative to a fire of this magnitude,"" the report said.
The MPD report determined officers must have the training and tools to respond even in a crisis that might be unimaginable. The report recommends equipping every police supervisor's vehicle with a ""breaching kit"" to clear blocked escape routes, ""to ensure lives are preserved,"" and to ""create go-bags of PPE for each motorized beat"" for emergency events.
The MPD's report also recommends more ""real-time crime center cameras"" that ""would not only reduce crime and response times to crimes, but also to be able to detect smoke"" from a centralized command location.

As the fire raged on Aug. 8, emergency dispatch saw an increase in calls for service that taxed a system that was already struggling to keep up with fires that came atop the normal types of police and medical calls, according to the MPD report.
The report said that, in August 2023, the police department's staffing was 25% shy of the number of police officers it should have, and the civilian dispatch ranks were even more depleted, with fewer than half the spots filled.
As the Maui wildfires tore through paradise, fire calls were ultimately ""coupled in"" to the calls for service and ""communications personnel were challenged to field three days' worth of calls within a single day,"" the police report said. ""Never in any current emergency services dispatcher's career have they experienced the volume of calls received on Aug. 8, 2023.""
In a crisis when fast, accurate communication is vital, it was stymied by the very elements that had conspired to cause the natural disaster, according to the report.
In the high winds, ""drones and aircraft were unable to assist"" with the crisis and ""unable to be deployed,"" according to the report. The Lahaina area was ""hit with a complete failure of commercial electrical service,"" leaving police to rely on two-way radios, the report said. But as wind made it impossible to hear what was being said on the radios, it ""led to some misunderstandings of radio transmissions,"" and with officers ""actively engaged in evacuations"" and the ""sheer number"" of circumstances before them, it was ""apparent that officers may have missed certain transmissions,"" according to the MPD report.
As emergency efforts in Lahaina continued, the lack of staffing at police headquarters meant that urgent radio traffic from that community was being fielded by ""a single dispatcher,"" the report found.
Emergency service dispatch stations ""should be equipped with radio capabilities,"" which would allow them to ""receive and dispatch additional support and calls,"" the MPD report recommends.
The county's two communication centers typically receive roughly 360 emergency 911 calls per day, according to the report -- but in the 24 hours of Aug. 8, it was 13 times that much: an ""unprecedented"" combined total of 4,523 calls, investigators found. The report recommends a ""dedicated phone line"" for disasters to streamline emergency messaging.

By the morning of Aug. 9, the first fatality was found and confirmed. It would be the first of many, the report said, and victim recovery ""would take weeks.""
""An anthropologist would work oftentimes on their hands and knees in a very detailed effort to recover everything that was recoverable,"" forensic pathologist Dr. Jeremy Stuelpnagel said at Monday’s press briefing. ""Sometimes the fragments were as small as a quarter, or smaller.""
As ""radio traffic overflowed, personnel were plentiful, however, there were not enough MPD vehicles for all personnel on duty,"" the police report said.
The morgue's facilities and storage had to expand, increasing its autopsy capacity by nearly 400% to accommodate the complex and sensitive process of identifying the many sets of charred remains, according to the report. The report recommends retrofitting the facility and preparing for possible future mass-casualty events.
In the aftermath, as families were desperate for answers, the community stood in shock and the nation watched in horror, misinformation and disinformation spread, the police report found.
Amid what was already a chaotic and terrifying situation, artificial intelligence was ""used to spread disinformation and undermine trust in the government,"" feeding confusion, the report said.
""In the days and weeks that followed the fires, there was voluminous information being disseminated that was both factual and fictitious,"" the report said. ""There was evidence of a concentrated effort, including some by foreign governments, as well as lone wolf actors, to disrupt the integrity of first responders, the community and government.""

A memorandum later found to be bogus and purportedly from FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell was ""sent to public and private entities hidden under a @proton.me email account,"" the report said, and claimed to highlight ""grave concerns"" about the ""handling"" of the wildfire disaster, and ""reveals serious lapses by local authorities, potential assumption of federal control and ongoing criminal investigations."" The fact that the memo was completely false didn't mitigate the damage it did, the MPD report said.
During the process of notifying families of the dead or injured, the report said, undermined trust posed a ""challenge.""
""Some of the families were uneasy with trusting government agencies as they were seeing and hearing conspiracies online, by word of mouth and in the media,"" the report said, and some were ""hesitant to give DNA samples to help identify family members if remains were recovered.""
""Allowing family members to participate and having the speakers, peer support and chaplains walk around and introduce themselves at the beginning of the briefing helped lower tensions and emotions,"" the report said, and teams made sure families knew the DNA samples would ""only be used for identification purposes and nothing more, leading more people to provide a sample after the briefing and more remains were identified.""
The final after-action report is expected in the next six to 12 months, Pelletier said.
""These were our worst hours. These were our finest moments,"" Pelletier said at Monday’s briefing. ""We are Maui strong.""

Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger ""would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,"" as well as both companies' employees.
""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-02-03,"As some consumers ditch Stanley cups, experts weigh overconsumption risks","As some consumers ditch their viral sensation Stanley cups over lead concerns, experts tell ABC News about overconsumption risks.","The widely popular Stanley Cups are flying off store shelves and can be seen quenching influencers' thirsts in videos online, however, these reusable cups may actually pose some sustainability concerns, experts told ABC News.
Several experts told ABC News that the transience of reusable cup and water bottle trends can promote overconsumption of these products and become counterproductive when weighed against the goal of supporting sustainability.
While experts agree that reusable products are a positive option for consumers hoping to make a more sustainable choice, many are saying companies encouraging people to buy unnecessary multiples of them is problematic.

Sandra Goldmark, circularity expert from Barnard College and the Columbia University Climate School, told ABC News that each of these products has an ""environmental payback period,"" and customers need to ""really understand why it's so unsustainable to buy multiple, durable items, and treat them more like a fast fashion item.""
""This [cup craze] is really kind of a funny intersection of something that can be green and more sustainable, i.e. a reusable product, but a marketing and fashion moment that is really, truly unsustainable, and it's an unfortunate intersection,"" Goldmark said.
Circularity experts, like Goldmark, look at economic models that focus on extending the life cycle of products through methods like reuse, repair, refurbishment and recycling.

Stanley was originally founded in 1913 with the goal of providing reusable ""built for life"" products to their customers.
""This mission of sustainability is a core value for Stanley and we prioritize use of recycled materials in our products, eliminating the need for single-use plastics and increasing recycled content every year,"" a spokesperson for Stanley told ABC News. ""We plan to continue to introduce more sustainable products through responsible design. We approach sustainability with the same spirit of innovation and originality that we approach our products.""
But, in recent years the company found viral popularity on apps such as TikTok, with influencers posting videos showing off their extensive collections and limited-edition designs.

Erica Cirino, communications manager for Plastics Pollution Coalition and author of ""Thicker Than Water: The Quest for Solutions to the Plastic Crisis,"" told ABC news that marketing hype has created a feeling of ""artificial scarcity"" around these products.
""Companies make 'limited-edition' special versions to create insane hype around their products, and sadly, it works,"" Cirino said. ""Companies selling reusable products need to step away from these tactics and instead help foster values that reduce wastefulness; for example, showing people how to properly care for their reusables, so folks do not feel compelled to repeatedly buy more.""
Goldmark notes that this specific trendy cup is not the only one. Other brands, such as Yeti and Hydroflask, have also developed devoted followings in recent years.
""A double-walled steel cup is a great thing, and it can last a lifetime, but it's also more energy and material intensive to make in the first place,"" Goldmark said. ""So there's something called an environmental payback period for any product.""
""If you want to compare a reusable coffee mug to, let's say, a single-use paper cup -- you have to use that steel cup for a long time, many months, maybe even many years, depending on how it was made in the first place, to earn back that investment of energy and materials,"" she explained.

And some are examining how Stanley makes its cups after several TikTok videos surfaced recently showing people testing their cups for lead. The company said ""no lead is present on the surface of any Stanley product.""
“Our manufacturing process currently employs the use of an industry standard pellet to seal the vacuum insulation at the base of our products; the sealing material includes some lead,” Stanley notes on its website. “Once sealed, this area is covered with a durable stainless steel layer, making it inaccessible to consumers.”
If the cap at the base of a cup comes off and exposes the pellet, the company continues, customers can submit a warranty claim on their website.
The FDA is ""aware of the situation,"" regarding reports of lead in Stanley cups, a spokesperson told ABC News.
""The agency has not received reports of lead poisoning concerning [Stanley] cups at this time. It is the responsibility of companies that manufacture products intended for use in contact with foods sold in the U.S., to comply with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the FDA’s regulations,"" the spokesperson said. ""As a general precaution, consumers should avoid drinking from broken or damaged cups.""
Stanley also says “its products meet all US regulatory requirements” and that it “tests for and validates compliance on all products through FDA accredited 3rd party labs”
While Stanley says the lead used in the manufacturing process doesn't pose a health risk, some TikTokers have been posting videos throwing their cups away since questions about lead have been raised, and encouraging followers to as well.

Some companies do have end-of-life plans for their products, if for whatever reason consumers decide they're done using them.
Yeti offers a buyback program for some of its products and Hydroflask offers a trade-in and recycling program.
ABC News asked Stanley whether the company has an end-of-life plan for their products and has not yet received a response.
Also, stainless steel is recyclable, though often not at the curbside, Cirino said. Alternative solutions, she suggested, could be to repurpose your reusable cups and bottles, or donate them.

As for the cup crazes, Goldmark says it's not realistic to think people will never get excited about a product like this and rush out to buy it.
""But I do think there's a way to do this more sustainably, both from the point of view of the of the person who's tempted by the viral craze and by the company,"" Goldmark said. ""More importantly by the company that's making it by leaning into reuse and repair and refurbishment and fun detailing and upcycling of these items.""
For consumers out on the market for a new reusable cup, Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics -- an environmental advocacy group focused on ending plastic pollution -- told ABC News that people should look for ""a durable metal container that has the least amount of plastic possible.""
""A much better choice than trying to collect trendy water bottles, is one, simple, 100% stainless steel, glass or unglazed earthen clay bottles that you can use over and over again -- with no exposure to microplastics,"" Cirino said. ""Consumers do need to be aware of corporate marketing tactics, and dig deep into their own values and mindsets. Before you buy a trendy new product, ask yourself, will you really use it?""
""It's not cool to be wasteful,"" she added.",,,,,,,,,,,,

2024-01-31,What to know about Elon Musk’s Neuralink brain chip implant,"Neuralink says its goal is to help people living with debilitating conditions, including paralysis, communicate and control external devices with their thoughts.","Elon Musk announced that his company Neuralink implanted a brain chip in a human in a preliminary clinical study. If research studies continue to look promising, devices like these could one day be a ""game changer"" for people with limited motor function, experts told ABC News.
Neuralink says its goal is to help people living with debilitating conditions, including paralysis, communicate and control external devices with their thoughts.
The patient who received the implant is ""recovering well,"" Musk said in a post on X Tuesday.
Musk's company is not alone in developing this type of technology. In recent years, research teams from across the globe have announced early but promising studies of brain-machine interface devices.
Here's what else to know about Neuralink.
Neuralink's implant
Neuralink was founded in 2016 by Musk and a team of scientists and engineers. The company says its mission is to ""create a generalized brain interface to restore autonomy to those with unmet medical needs,"" according to its website.
The company says its device can interpret neural activity so a person can operate a computer or smartphone by simply thinking.
Neuralink says its devices can help people with debilitating conditions control external devices.
Neuralink
People paralyzed from a stroke, a traumatic brain injury or a spinal cord injury could see the benefits, the company says.
""This would be a major game changer if it could be proven to be safe and effective,"" Dr. Leah Croll, a neurologist and assistant professor at Temple University, told ABC News.

Human trials after animal testing
The FDA approved Neuralink for human trials in May after years of testing on animals.
The company has previously demonstrated the ability of the implant to stimulate movement in pigs and monkeys, even demonstrating a monkey with a brain chip playing a video game.
A Neuralink brain chip implant is handled by a scientist.

Musk said the first human users will be those who lost the use of their limbs.
""Imagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate faster than a speed typist or auctioneer, that is the goal,"" Musk said.
Science fiction into reality
Neuralink's engineers aren't the only ones exploring this emerging science.
Last year, Swiss researchers said they combined artificial intelligence and brain and spine implants to help a man paralyzed in a motorcycle accident walk again.

2024-01-31,Taylor Swift and No AI Fraud Act: How Congress plans to fight back against AI deepfakes,"How lawmakers hope to create a federal, baseline protection against AI abuse and uphold Americans' First Amendment rights online.","Taylor Swift's likeness was used for nonconsensual, seemingly AI-generated, deepfake pornography, which spread across the Internet like wildfire last week.
The mass circulation of the photos commanded headlines and re-confronted lawmakers with a question: Should U.S. citizens be federally protected against AI abuse?
The potential obscene ramifications of the Artificial Intelligence technology boom have long been feared by cyber civil rights organizations, such as CCRI, and are now seemingly unavoidable by the public and lawmakers alike.
Many social media users saw the explicit, fabricated images of Swift last week, which was met with decries from Swift's massive fanbase, ""alarm"" from the White House and outspoken fear of AI abuse from lawmakers such as Rep. Joe Morelle, D-NY, who is renewing efforts to make nonconsensual sharing of digitally-altered explicit images a federal crime, with jail time and fines.
One post on X that shared screenshots of the fabricated images of Swift was reportedly viewed over 47 million times before the account was suspended on Thursday, according to a New York Times report. X continued to suspend several accounts sharing the explicit images and made a ""temporary action"" to block all searches for Swift on the platform until Tuesday.
Elon Musk's social media platform re-enabled searches for Swift's name on Tuesday.
""Search has been re-enabled and we will continue to be vigilant for any attempt to spread this content and will remove it if we find it,"" Joe Benarroch, head of business operations at X, said in a statement, according to Associated Press.

Before being re-enabled, If a user searched for Swift on the site, a message appeared that reads: ""Something went wrong. Try reloading,"" according to X.
Despite X's attempt to stop the rapid spread of these images on its platform, the photos have been shared on other social media sites and online spaces regardless of efforts to remove and block them.
""We are alarmed by the reports of the ... circulation of images that you just laid out -- of false images to be more exact, and it is alarming,"" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told ABC News on Friday.
A bipartisan group of U.S. House lawmakers -- led by Rep. María Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., alongside Reps. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., Nathaniel Moran, R-Texas, Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., and Rob Wittman, R-Va., -- introduced the No Artificial Intelligence Fake Replicas And Unauthorized Duplications (No AI FRAUD) Act on Jan. 10.
The lawmakers said they hope to create a federal, baseline protection against AI abuse and uphold Americans' First Amendment rights online.
MORE: Fake explicit Taylor Swift images: White House is 'alarmed'
The bill aims to ""establish a federal framework to protect Americans' individual right to their likeness and voice against AI-generated fakes and forgeries,"" according to Salazar's press release.
""What happened to Taylor Swift is a clear example of AI abuse. My bill, the No AI FRAUD Act, will punish bad actors using generative AI to hurt others — celebrity or not,"" Salazar said in a statement to ABC News. ""Everyone should be entitled to their own image and voice and my bill seeks to protect that right.""
In the past two years, AI technology has advanced, spread and become simplified from highly technical coding to user-friendly apps and websites, such as ChatGBT, that have fueled an entire online industry.
MORE: How AI could affect jobs
Amid the AI boom, private companies are sprinting to create the most accessible tools for online users to create fabricated images, video, text and audio recordings of anything and everything they'd like. When a creator makes an AI-generated impersonation of a human, it's called a ""deepfake.""
Deepfake pornography, which Swift fell victim to, is often described as image-based sexual abuse.
The No AI FRAUD Act, if passed, would create a federal jurisdiction that will:
Reaffirm that everyone's likeness and voice is protected and give individuals the right to control the use of their identifying characteristics.
Empower individuals to enforce this right against those who facilitate, create and spread AI frauds without their permission.
Balance the rights against First Amendment protections to safeguard speech and innovation.
""My thoughts are with Taylor Swift during this immensely distressing time. And my thoughts are with every other person who has been victimized by harmful AI deepfakes,"" Rep. Dean told ABC News in a statement. ""If this deeply disturbing privacy violation could happen to Taylor Swift — TIME's 2023 person of the year — it is unimaginable to think how helpless other vulnerable women and children must also feel.""
Rep. Dean continued, ""at a time of rapidly evolving AI, it is critical that Congress creates protections against harmful AI. My and Rep. Maria Salazar's No AI FRAUD Act is intended to target the MOST harmful kinds of AI deepfakes by giving victims like Taylor Swift a chance to fight back in civil court.""
MORE: AI companies will need to start reporting their safety tests to the US government
Rep. Morelle said he hopes the abuse against Swift will be a driving force in getting the No AI FRAUD Act established.
""We're certainly hopeful the Taylor Swift news will help spark momentum and grow support for our bill, which as you know, would address her exact situation with both criminal and civil penalties,"" a spokesperson for Morelle told ABC News.
Since 2019, 17 states have enacted 29 bills focused on regulating the design, development and use of artificial intelligence, according to the Council of State Governments. However, not all have language that target the issue of pornographic deepfake, and the variety of language and destinctions allows for abuse to fall through the cracks, according to Salazar's press release.
""Laws at the state level to address these issues are inconsistent and, in some cases, not enough,"" the release notes.
Using Swift's possible case as an example, the singer has residences in Tennessee, New York, Rhode Island and California.

Tennessee currently does not have a law that explicitly bans deepfake porn. However, Gov. Bill Lee proposed a bill this month -- the Ensuring Likeness Voice and Image Security (ELVIS) Act -- which aims to amend the state's Protection of Personal Rights law to include AI protection.
New York State does offer criminal and civil options for victims of deepfake abuse. In 2023, the state banned the distribution of pornographic images made using AI without the subject's consent. Violators in New York could face a $1,000 fine and up to a year in jail.
""Since successfully expanding the right of publicity under New York State law I have been working to highlight the dangers of Artificial Intelligence and ensure we are taking steps to protect a person's likeness,"" Morelle said in the bill's press release. ""Now it is apparent we must take immediate action to stop the abuse of AI technology by providing a federal law to empower individuals being victimized, and end AI FRAUD. I'm grateful to my colleagues for supporting this bipartisan effort and look forward to our work together stopping AI fakes and forgeries.""
Rhode Island does not currently have deepfake or synthetic media laws.
California passed a law in 2020 to allow victims of nonconsensual, deepfake pornography to sue the creators and distributors for $150,000 if the deepfake was ""committed with malice.""
Taylor Swift has not publicly commented on the AI deepfake images.

2024-01-27,Fake explicit Taylor Swift images: White House is 'alarmed',Lawmakers are calling upon Congress to pass legislation that would regulate artificial intelligence.,"Millions came across fake sexually explicit AI-generated images of Taylor Swift on social media this week, underscoring for many the need to regulate potential nefarious uses of AI technology.
The White House Press Secretary told ABC News Friday they are ""alarmed"" by what happened to Swift online and that Congress ""should take legislative action.""
""We are alarmed by the reports of the…circulation of images that you just laid out - of false images to be more exact, and it is alarming,"" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told ABC News White House Correspondent Karen L. Travers.
""While social media companies make their own independent decisions about content management, we believe they have an important role to play in enforcing their own rules to prevent the spread of misinformation, and non-consensual, intimate imagery of real people,"" she added.

Jean-Pierre highlighted some of the actions the administration has taken recently on these issues including: launching a task force to address online harassment and abuse and the Department of Justice launching the first national 24/7 helpline for survivors of image-based sexual abuse.
And the White House is not alone, outraged fans were surprised to find out that there is no federal law in the U.S. that would prevent or deter someone from creating and sharing non-consensual deepfake images.
But just last week, Rep. Joe Morelle renewed a push to pass a bill that would make nonconsensual sharing of digitally-altered explicit images a federal crime, with jail time and fines.
""We're certainly hopeful the Taylor Swift news will help spark momentum and grow support for our bill, which as you know, would address her exact situation with both criminal and civil penalties,"" a spokesperson for Morelle told ABC News.

Deepfake pornography is often described as image-based sexual abuse -- a term that also includes the creation and sharing of non-fabricated intimate images.
A few years back, a user needed to have a certain level of technical skills to create AI-generated content with rapid advances in AI technology, but now it's a matter of downloading an app or clicking a few buttons.
Now experts say there's an entire commercial industry that thrives on creating and sharing digitally manufactured content that appears to feature sexual abuse. Some of the websites airing these fakes have thousands of paying members.
Last year, a town in Spain made international headlines after a number of young schoolgirls said they received fabricated nude images of themselves that were created using an easily accessible ""undressing app"" powered by artificial intelligence, raising a larger discussion about the harm these tools can cause.
The sexually explicit Swift images were likely fabricated using an artificial intelligence text-to-image tool. Some of the images were shared on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.
One post sharing screenshots of the fabricated images was reportedly viewed over 45 million times before the account was suspended on Thursday.
Early Friday morning, X's safety team said it was ""actively removing all identified images"" and ""taking appropriate actions against the accounts responsible for posting them.""
""Posting Non-Consensual Nudity (NCN) images is strictly prohibited on X and we have a zero-tolerance policy towards such content,"" read the statement. ""We're closely monitoring the situation to ensure that any further violations are immediately addressed, and the content is removed. We're committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all users.""
Stefan Turkheimer, RAINN Vice President of Public Policy, a nonprofit anti-sexual assault organization, said that on a daily basis ""more than more than 100,000 images and videos like this are spread across the web, a virus in their own right. We are angry on behalf of Taylor Swift, and angrier still for the millions of people who do not have the resources to reclaim autonomy over their images.""",, and it's this race to the bottom where negative polarization takes over, meaning the people voting for a candidate don't like that candidate. They just are taught to hate the other candidate more, and it's this, not lesser of two evils at this point. It's a lesser of what the frick are we doing here?,,,,,,,
2024-01-27,The perils of giving birth in war-torn Gaza,"Amid the chaos, destruction and uncertainty of Israel's siege on the Gaza Strip, one group stands out among the most vulnerable -- mothers with their newborn babies.","LONDON and GAZA -- Amid the chaos, destruction and uncertainty of Israel's siege on the neighboring Gaza Strip, one group stands out among the most vulnerable -- mothers with their newborn babies. Aid agencies are growing increasingly concerned for their wellbeing.
""Women face elevated risks during pregnancy and post-delivery, placing their newborns in jeopardy due to the dire humanitarian situation and the absence or limited access to nutrition, hygiene and basic health services,"" Ammar M. Ammar, regional chief of advocacy and communication for the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, told ABC News.
""Pregnancy during conflict is linked to an increase in miscarriages, congenital abnormalities, stillbirths, preterm labor, maternal mortality and mental health,"" he added. ""And the trauma of war can also directly affect newborns.""
An estimated 180 mothers a day are giving birth in war-torn Gaza each day, according to UNICEF.
""These women are unable to access the emergency obstetric services they need to give birth safely and care for their newborns,” Ammar said. “Women are having to give birth in shelters, in their homes, in the streets amid rubble, or in overwhelmed health care facilities, where sanitation is worsening, and the risk of infection and medical complications is on the rise.""

Fatima Suleiman, 35, from Gaza City, said she gave birth during the first month of the war.
""I became pregnant with my daughter after long attempts to have a baby,"" Suleiman told ABC News. ""Every day, I dreamed of the moment of the birth of that baby girl. I felt happy.""
The war broke out after Gaza’s militant rulers, Hamas, launched a surprise invasion into southern Israel on Oct. 7, which killed more than 1,200 people, according to the Israel Defense Forces, marking the deadliest one-day attack in Israeli history. Israel has since retaliated with a military campaign in Gaza, attacking the tiny coastal enclave by air, land and sea amid its determination to obliterate Hamas. More than 25,700 Palestinians have been killed and over 63,000 have been injured, according to Gaza’s Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health.
""When the war began, the feeling of anxiety increased,” Suleima said, “and I prayed daily that the war would end before the time of the birth.""
""I was very afraid at that moment. How would I go to the hospital, and how would I survive the constant bombing?” she continued. “We went to Al-Shifa Hospital before it was stormed in mid-October and it was a very difficult night. We got there with difficulty. Very carefully, by cesarean section, I gave birth to my baby girl, Nabila.""
After giving birth, the Israeli military began asking residents of Gaza City to move south, which Suleima said “was very difficult” because she had not yet recovered from the cesarean section and “could not walk long distances.” Once she was mobile, Suleiman and her family headed to the southern city of Khan Younis, where they took shelter in a bombed-out house belonging to her husband’s relative. Suleiman said she now only eats one meal a day and is forced to drink salty water due to a lack of resources in war-ravaged Gaza.
""This is the suffering of displacement and movement, and I am in a bad condition from childbirth,"" she told ABC News. ""I have had a cesarean section and I am breastfeeding my daughter, and I need healthy food in order to provide milk in my breasts for breastfeeding. But unfortunately there is no food in the market, and we cannot buy much of it due to the high cost, which requires a lot of money.""
""I felt that I could not breastfeed my child when I put the breast in her mouth. She screams and cries because there is no milk because she is not nourished,"" she added. ""The child needs food for her health and immunity, otherwise she will contract many diseases. We are forced to buy formula milk from pharmacies in order to breastfeed the child. I do not want to lose her during this painful war.""
Suleiman said she’s far less concerned about feeding herself than feeding her baby.
""I no longer care about eating, even if it is one meal,"" she said. ""The most important thing is to save money to buy milk for my daughter so that she can get a little full.""
UNICEF warned that Suleiman's situation is being repeated across Gaza.
""The deteriorating situation is raising concerns about acute malnutrition and mortality breaching famine thresholds,"" Ammar told ABC News. ""UNICEF is particularly worried about the nutrition of the over 155,000 pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as well as more than 135,000 children under 2, given their specific nutrition needs and vulnerability.""
Navin Al-Barbari, 33, from Gaza City, said she has been having a similarly traumatic experience of motherhood.
""I certainly had a great fear of giving birth because the nonstop bombing of Gaza City was so worrying and the large number of injuries and the Ministry of Health's appeals to save the health system made me feel that I would not find a hospital to receive me to give birth,"" Al-Barbari told ABC News.
""In mid-October, on a night when the bombing was intense, I went to Al-Shifa Hospital to give birth there,"" she continued. ""I could not bear the mothers screaming for their martyred children. The hospital was very crowded with people. The number of displaced people there was large. I was very afraid of losing my baby, but I survived the birth.""

Al-Barbari said she gave birth via cesarean section as she was in a state of anxiety and the doctors wanted to deliver the baby quickly. She said she returned home with her newborn but could not stay there for long as Israeli tanks were approaching her neighborhood of Al Zaytoun in Gaza City.
""We were thinking of moving to the south, but it was not easy because I gave birth by cesarean section and I could not bear long walks,"" she said. ""We did not find food in Gaza, and my daughter was screaming day and night because she was hungry.""

Al-Barbari eventually evacuated to Gaza’s southernmost city, Rafah, with most of her family.
""The crowding in the city of Rafah has made prices very high due to the lack of supplies and food,"" she said. ""I do not eat, but my child needs to eat because she is very small, and I was forced to buy artificial milk for her.”
""I was afraid of war because I was pregnant with my child, but the fear doubled even more when she became alive,” she added. ""I do not know how to protect her from this -- the bombing. And I don't know how we will be able to buy milk on an ongoing basis for her, as it is very expensive and we have no financial income.""
Al-Barbari also expressed concerned about her own mental and physical health.
""I still feel the pains of childbirth, and I still feel great psychological fatigue and distress. This war did not give me the opportunity to be happy with my daughter,"" she said.
But Al-Barbari and Suleiman are among the lucky ones -- because their children are still alive. Pascale Coissard, emergency coordinator in Gaza for international medical charity Doctors Without Borders, shared the story of one mother who lost her baby.
""She went to a hospital when she felt labor was starting, but she couldn't be treated,” Coissard told ABC News. “All the delivery rooms were full. She knew something wasn't right, that she needed to be admitted -- she had had a C-section before. But with no other option, she had to go back to her tent.""
""Her son died. She gave birth to him in the latrines closest to her tent,"" she added. ""Without this war, she would not have lost her son.""

2024-01-26,Tesla stock plummets more than 10% after earnings miss expectations,Tesla also warned of sluggish production in 2024.,"Shares of Tesla plummeted more than 10% in afternoon trading on Thursday, less than 24 hours after the company reported earnings that fell short of expectations and cautioned of sluggish sales over the duration of this year.
Revenue and profits missed analyst expectations over the three months ending in December, according to the earnings report released on Wednesday.
In all, the company delivered 1.81 million cars in 2023, more than it had in any previous year, the earnings report said. However, Tesla has cut prices as it faces increased competition, putting downward pressure on the company's revenue.
Further, the company's vehicle delivery growth ""may be notably lower"" in 2024, Tesla said in the earnings release.
""Tesla is nothing more than a struggling car company,"" Gordon Johnson, CEO and founder of data firm GLJ Research, who is bearish on Tesla, told investors in a note Thursday reviewed by ABC News.
MORE: Elon Musk wants more control of Tesla. Why some experts say it could be risky
For its part, Tesla said the slowdown owes to the company's focus on developing a ""next-generation vehicle"" that will arrive as soon as the second half of 2025. That improved vehicle will supercharge sales, the company said.
""Our company is currently between two major growth waves,"" the earnings report said. ""The first one began with the global expansion of the Model 3/Y platform and the next one we believe will be initiated by the global expansion of the next-generation vehicle platform.""
The explanation, echoed during a conference call Wednesday, failed to allay the concerns of Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush, who is typically bullish on the company.
The conference call, Ives told ABC News in a statement, amounted to a ""trainwreck.""

The earnings report has shaken the ""near-term confidence"" previously endorsed at Wedbush, Ives added. ""But we remain firm on a long-term bull thesis around Tesla and the broader AI story set to take hold,"" he added.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk drew attention last week when he said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he's seeking greater voting control of the electric carmaker, threatening to otherwise pursue major projects such as artificial intelligence outside of the company.

The Tesla board, Musk said, should grant him 25% voting control, an amount that would nearly double the vote share currently afforded to Musk through his stake in the company.
The company has also faced government inquiries over risks posed by some of the technology in its vehicles.
In December, Tesla agreed to recall about 2 million cars over a safety issue tied to its autopilot system, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said. Earlier this month, the company recalled an additional 1.6 million vehicles exported to China, citing a problem with the car's assisted steering system.
The uncertainty that looms over the company, Ives said, amounts to a ""bitter pill to swallow for the bulls.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,"'The Rock' appointed to UFC, WWE's TKO Group board of directors",요약 없음,"""The Rock"" is going to need some new custom business suits for his well-muscled 6-foot-5 frame.
Dwayne Johnson, the actor, former WWE star and most followed American man on social media platforms in the world, was appointed Tuesday to the board of directors of TKO Group, the publicly traded company consisting of the UFC and WWE.
Johnson is one of the most well-known wrestlers to ever come out of WWE, winning the promotion's championship eight times.
In addition to his appointment, Johnson, 51, has been granted full ownership of ""The Rock"" trademark, which had been owned by WWE. And Johnson has signed a new services and merchandising agreement with WWE ""that provides for his promotional, licensing, and other services,"" per a release.
""Being on the TKO Board of Directors, and taking full ownership of my name, 'The Rock,' is not only unprecedented, but incredibly inspiring as my crazy life is coming full circle,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""At my core, I'm a builder who builds for and serves the people, and [TKO CEO] Ari [Emanuel] is building something truly game-changing.
""I'm very motivated to help continue to globally expand our TKO, WWE, and UFC businesses as the worldwide leaders in sports and entertainment -- while proudly representing so many phenomenal athletes and performers who show up every day putting in the hard work with their own two hands to make their dreams come true and deliver for our audiences. I've been there, I'm still there and this is for them.""
Earlier this month, Johnson teased a potential match with his cousin, WWE universal champion Roman Reigns, in an appearance on WWE Raw. The match could happen at WrestleMania 40 in April. If it comes to fruition, it would be Johnson's first proper wrestling match since 2013.
Since his time in WWE, he's been busy, whether it be with his TV and film studio Seven Bucks Productions or Teremana Tequila or Zoa Energy or Project Rock, the Under Armour apparel line that has a deal with the UFC for fighters' fight-week footwear. Johnson is also a partner in the recently merged United Football League.
Despite all of his ventures, Johnson has stayed connected to TKO's properties. He will star as MMA legend and UFC veteran Mark Kerr in an upcoming movie, and he is a vocal fan of the UFC (Johnson is a longtime friend of WWE president Nick Khan). Nahnatchka Khan, Nick's sister, was the creator and executive producer of Johnson's show ""Young Rock.""
""Very few people on the planet understand the convergence of sports, entertainment, media, and business like 'Rock,'"" TKO executive chairman Vince McMahon said in a statement. ""We are proud to have him join the TKO board to help take our company to new heights.""
""The Rock"" name comes from Johnson's original name in WWE, Rocky Maivia, which was a tribute to his family. Johnson is a third-generation professional wrestler. His grandfather was ""High Chief"" Peter Maivia and his father was Rocky Johnson, who was the first Black champion in WWE history (winning the tag titles with Tony Atlas). Both are in the WWE Hall of Fame.
""My grandfather, 'High Chief' Peter Maivia, and my dad, Rocky 'Soulman' Johnson, would've never thought this day would come,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""Which is why I'm very humbled to have a seat at the table that has decades of history and family legacy for me. A table that my family helped to build.""
The TKO Group's board will expand to 13 people with the appointment of Johnson and Brad Keywell, the CEO of artificial intelligence company Uptake Technologies.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Its Election Law Unit ""works closely with our local, state, and federal partners,"" a spokesperson with the New Hampshire Attorney General's office added. Though ""the voice in the robocall sounds like the voice of President Biden, this message appears to be artificially generated based on initial indications,"" the NHAG's office said.
Who is behind the robocalls is still unclear, as is how many people have received the message, officials said.
The state attorney general spokesperson told ABC that at this time, they do know ""approximately a dozen"" people took the step of calling to request being removed from future calls, and ""approximately half a dozen"" people sent a complaint to either the New Hampshire Attorney General's office or the New Hampshire Secretary of State's office.
The robocall ends with a phone number belonging to Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair, who now runs a super PAC supporting the effort urging Granite State Democrats to write in Biden's name this primary.
In an interview with ABC on Monday, Sullivan said she does not know who is responsible for the robocalls, or how many people have been impacted -- and doesn't feel comfortable speculating -- but hopes the investigation will yield results.
""Hopefully, who's been doing this won't be able to do this in the future,"" she said. ""You shouldn't be telling people you shouldn't go and vote. That's crazy. That undermines our democracy. It's just not right. I've been calling it an unpardonable sin.""

2024-01-22,Exploring a vast Hamas tunnel complex where hostages were reportedly held captive: Reporter's notebook,The Israel Defense Forces took ABC News inside a Hamas tunnel complex where they say 20 hostages were held.,"KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza -- Aboard the shockingly loud Leopard APC, the Israeli army took us through the ruins of eastern Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip.
The military vehicle deposited us in a neighborhood that had been partially bulldozed. You could hear tank and machine gun fire in the distance. Beyond what has become a tank parking lot was the neighborhood, with every building severely damaged. A hole had been blown through one of the homes revealing an anteroom to a tunnel shaft. Inside the tunnel: a set of stairs, a landing, then another set of stairs. It was somewhere between 45 to 60 feet deep, the soldiers said.

The warren of tunnels beneath contained, said the Israel Defense Forces, something more sinister than they had found in the past -- a set of cells where hostages were kept.
Several flights of stairs cut down into the clay, leading us to a steel padlocked gate -- from there, the tunnel zigs and zags for dozens of yards. Each off-shoot is connected by a joint, many of which had been booby-trapped, that one has to crab walk to get through.
Israeli soldiers still guarded the unexplored tunnel off-shoots. Everything appears to be connected to something down there.

The tunnels were suffocatingly hot and damp. The lack of oxygen makes even walking strenuous. Our camera instantly fogged up and the concrete walls and arches beaded sweat. There were bunches of wires attached to the walls, apparently connecting electricity, data and other wires into the deepest parts of the tunnels. Most of the tunnel was high enough to walk in with ease. After a straightaway of hundreds of yards, the tunnel jagged past a caved-in section where the IDF said Hamas tried to booby-trap the tunnel.
There were multiple tunnel off-shoots, with one of them leading us to a large room with a vaulted ceiling plastered white, walls colored with tiled walls and carpeted with artificial grass. The soldiers said they believed it was used to hold women and children hostages, showing us a child's drawing they said a 5-year-old hostage said they drew. Among the litter of bedding, first aid kits and diapers were empty tubes marked RPG and what appeared to be Hamas' logo.

Just beyond the common area was a kitchen. Beyond that, bathrooms and boilers for hot water. The room split into two tunnels (we really got a sense of why Israeli officials call it ""the metro,"" with its bewildering number of turns and side tunnels, and the immense amount of investment that went into building it.)
To the left was another long tunnel, plastered white, that hooked right and revealed a row of what the IDF called hostage cells. They were fully tiled, white with a band of purple tiles and had bathrooms. They were about 12 feet long and 5 feet wide. A mattress or two was left on the floor. It's there the IDF says Hamas held several hostages.

IDF Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said they found the DNA of hostages there and articles of clothing like bras and underwear.
The cells had cage-like doors that opened into the tunnel. It took 10 minutes to make our way all the way in, and as long to head back out. Hagari said there are still hundreds of unexplored shafts, including ones where hostages could be held barely a half mile from where we were.
I asked Hagari whether the apocalyptic destruction we saw above ground was necessary, and whether Israel wanted all Palestinians to suffer for Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel.
""We do not see collective punishment,"" he said. ""We seek only to rescue hostages and to take down Hamas. Kill the leadership team. Kill the industries of rockets and ruin the industries of rockets ... So we do the necessary thing in order to minimize the collateral damage.""

Israeli officials say 532 IDF soldiers have been killed, including 195 since the ground operations in Gaza began.
The IDF has said it is only targeting Hamas and other militants in Gaza and alleges that Hamas deliberately shelters behind civilians, which the group denies.
I asked Hagari about Israeli Cabinet ministers like Itamar Ben Gvir calling for the reoccupation of Gaza. He said Israel's goal is ""to dismantle Hamas so it cannot be the sovereign in Gaza and there cannot be another 10/7 ... There is no mission of controlling the population, no mission of shoving the population to another country.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-01-21,Authorities map out potential threats ahead of New Hampshire primary,"Before the first ballot is cast in New Hampshire's presidential primary, authorities are mapping out potential threats and strategizing how to stop them.","Before the first ballot is cast in New Hampshire's presidential primary, authorities are already mapping out potential threats to its election -- and strategizing how to stop them, according to a new assessment by the New Hampshire Information and Analysis Center (NHIAC).
The confidential analysis, distributed to law enforcement on Wednesday and obtained by ABC News, describes an array of possible plots by those who might seek to disturb the first-in-the-nation primary Tuesday.
The document notes there is ""no information to indicate any specific, credible threat."" But it underscores that this should not lull law enforcement and government officials into disregarding potential risks -- and the grave importance of vigorously troubleshooting would-be attacks in advance.
""The NHIAC remains concerned about threats posed by foreign terrorist organizations, racially motivated violent extremists, domestic violent extremists, homegrown violent extremists, and other nation-state or criminal actors looking to disrupt the US elections,"" the bulletin said.
""Numerous attacks and disrupted plots in recent years demonstrate the continued interest"" of foreign and domestic extremists to prey on ""mass gatherings and other soft targets,"" including ""symbolic events,"" the bulletin said. Few political events are more symbolic than the first primary. And, officials warn, that there are those who ""have the ability to disrupt, suppress, or discourage voters from participating"" in New Hampshire.
The new analysis comes at the start of the high-stakes presidential election season and during a time of heightened threats of almost every type.

""The 2024 election cycle is occurring at a time when the US is facing one of the most volatile and dangerous threat environments it's faced since Sept. 11,"" said John Cohen, the former intelligence chief at the Department of Homeland Security and now an ABC News contributor. ""In today's threat environment, the lack of credible information regarding a specific plot or attack does not mean the threat is not out there. We know the threat is there.""
A powder keg global environment looms over the 2024 presidential primary, experts say. The 2024 election was already going to be the first presidential race since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. It is also marked by increasingly toxic political rhetoric, the intermingling of the courtroom and campaign trail as former President Donald Trump faces four criminal trials and the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. In addition, hate speech, misinformation and disinformation are running rampant on social media, and rapidly evolving technology remains vulnerable, experts say.

These circumstances present ripe opportunities for adversarial countries who have ""aimed to influence US elections in the past by undermining public confidence in the electoral process and exacerbating sociopolitical divisions,"" the New Hampshire analysis said.
""The current threat environment rests on the foundation of anger, the polarization that has become all too pervasive in our society. And pervasive in our political discourse as well,"" Cohen said. ""Election officials need to be prepared to counteract if something occurs -- but you can't wait 'til it happens.""
Some state election officials, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, have already been the victim of ""swatting"" incidents -- false reports of an ongoing emergency or threat to prompt an immediate tactical law enforcement response, intended to cause fear and harass -- as well as death threats and other harassment.
Public events -- especially contentious political ones -- offer a ""convenient target for anyone already considering violence, or a way to express their grievance, or to disrupt things,"" said Elizabeth Neumann, former DHS assistant secretary and an ABC News contributor. ""So, we need our law enforcement to be as agile as possible.""

The New Hampshire analysis outlines potential threats from foreign ""cyber operations"" to ""covert influence operations"" targeting election security, political parties, campaigns or public officials, the analysis said. Advancing and increasingly ""hyper-realistic"" artificial intelligence is an ""expected"" tool to ""spread false narratives and influence public perception.""
The bulletin also includes a detailed list of ""potential threat indicators"" that could signal ""pre-operational surveillance or attack planning"" that law enforcement officials should be on the lookout for -- like suspicious and ""unattended"" luggage that could conceal explosives, an ""increase in social media traffic discussing event vulnerabilities"" as well as ""loss of power at event locations, creating an inability to hold voting.""
State and local election websites, email addresses and social media platforms are ""among the top election vulnerable platforms,"" according to the bulletin, with phishing schemes and other efforts enabling malicious access to networks and servers ""which can negatively impact elections and/or election infrastructure.""
New Hampshire holds voting ""through secure, non-electronic, means,"" the bulletin notes: voting is conducted ""through paper ballots, counted by offline machines and are then transported to the Secretary of State's Office, via the New Hampshire State Police.""

""As with all large-scale events in the state, we are working with our federal, state and local law enforcement partners to ensure preparedness for any potential emergency situation,"" Dumont said. ""Our members are committed to ensuring all citizens can vote safely on Tuesday.""

2024-01-21,New nonprofit to utilize AI to alleviate the global water crisis,A new nonprofit has become the latest organization to utilize artificial intelligence to help solve the world's environmental issues.,"A new nonprofit has become the latest organization to utilize artificial intelligence to help solve the world's environmental issues.
Earth05 -- a Barcelona-based nonprofit launched on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum -- will use AI to discover solutions to the global water crisis, which experts predict will worsen exponentially in the coming decades.
Water is fundamental to almost all factors of human activity and life, but water scarcity is now becoming a global endemic, Upmanu Lall, director of Columbia University's Water Center, told ABC News.

Currently, about 2.2 billion people around the world do not have access to safely managed drinking water, according to the United Nations. By 2030, global freshwater demand is expected to outstrip supply by 40%, leaving an estimated 1.6 billion people without safely managed drinking water, according to the World Economic Forum.
Earth05 is seeking to counteract this looming forecast by integrating water, education and AI across all initiatives, aiming to use the collective efforts by ""brilliant minds"" working together to improve the lives of 500 million people by 2030, Maria Dahrieh, founder and president of Earth05, told ABC News.
MORE: How scientists are tracking mosquitoes that could be carrying deadly diseases
New technology will allow the nonprofit to analyze future systems, from water consumption to availability of water based on predicted climate conditions. AI will make these predictions possible for the first time, Dahrieh said.
Some of the ways AI can be used to alleviate the global water crisis, include optimizing delivery systems to make them more efficient, detecting leakages of water -- which can range from 10% to 30% of the water supply in the U.S., depending on the region -- and predicting when certain spikes for contaminants will occur, Pablo Ortiz, climate and waters scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told ABC News.
AI's ability to create better irrigation systems will be integral as well, since the vast majority of the water use in the world -- ranging from 70% to 90%, depending on the region -- goes toward agriculture, Lall said. And since there are frequent instances in which the wrong crop is being grown for the water and climate conditions of a particular region, AI will also be able to analyze the suitability of crops being grown in a certain location, Lall said.

Ortiz also believes another ""exciting"" way AI can be used to solve the global water crisis is for education. One example could be using virtual reality headsets to illustrate how dire conditions are in some of the most water-scarce countries, which could bring the ""urgency"" of the problem to the forefront of people's minds.
""AI can give us these predictabilities that that we need in order to to see the possibilities of what could be done,"" Dahrieh said.

Just a little more than 1.2% of all freshwater in the world is drinkable surface water, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The rest is tied up in groundwater (30.1%) and glaciers and ice caps (68.7%).
The research conducted by Earth05 will help to find ways to access frozen water or water buried deep in the ground, Dahrieh said.
Another one of the biggest factors affecting water supply is inequities between supply and demand, another consequence of a growing global population, experts told ABC News.

Some of the most regions around the world with the greatest demand-supply imbalance include the Middle East, where several countries obtain their water supplies by desalination, as well as Mexico, Brazil, India and China, Lall said. In the U.S., the western part of the country, as well as the Mississippi River basin, are at most risk, he added.
Climate change, as well as natural climate variability, is also affecting the world water supply, the experts said.
Climate change is making the water cycle more unstable by contributing to longer and more frequent droughts, diminishing the snowpack that feeds rivers in the spring, as well as causing more severe flooding during extreme precipitation, Ortiz said.
Although it may seem counterintuitive, floods can drag a lot of contaminants and pollutants into water supplies, Ortiz said.

It is important to recognize that even AI uses considerable amounts of water, the experts said. Research published last year by the University of California, Riverside, found that for every five to 50 prompts on ChapGPT, about 16 ounces of water is used. The water is used to cool the servers used to power these super computers, Ortiz said.
To compare, it takes about 600 gallons of water to produce one hamburger patty, Ortiz said.

The availability of water has historically been taken for granted, and in past decades the precious resource has been treated as a political agenda rather than a human right, Dahrieh said.
Ortiz described water as the most precious natural resource, after air.
""Everyone needs water every day to subsist,"" Ortiz said. ""People are literally dying from not having water available or because the water is contaminated or because the water is not available to grow the food.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-01-19,Big Tech layoffs are back. Are other workers at risk?,"Job cuts economy-wide stand at a near-historic low, but tech could be a bellwether.","Big Tech companies laid off hundreds of employees in recent days, commanding headlines and confronting workers across the economy with a question: Am I next?
Amazon and Google each imposed cuts, with Apple shutting down a 121-person team in San Diego, Calif., telling workers they must either transfer to Texas or leave the company, Bloomberg reported.
In all, the tech sector has laid off nearly 8,000 workers so far this year, according to layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks tech-sector employment.
The job cuts stem in large part from an ongoing staff reevaluation specific to the tech industry, since sales have retreated from the blistering pace attained during the pandemic, analysts said, noting comparatively scant layoffs across the wider workforce.
However, the recent cutbacks in tech also are due to the rise of artificial intelligence and the persistence of high interest rates, some analysts said, foretelling similar risks for workers across major swathes of the economy.
MORE: Bank overdraft fees may soon plummet. Here's what to know.
""I could see some layoffs in other areas of the economy but not as widespread as we're seeing in tech,"" Joshua White, Vanderbilt University finance professor and former economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission, told ABC News.
The string of high-profile job cuts arrives at a time when employment in the wider labor force remains robust.
A stronger-than-expected jobs report demonstrated solid hiring growth in December, rebuking fears of a shrinking workforce anytime soon, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
The layoff rate for November, the most recent month on record, stands at a near-historic low of 1%, according to BLS data.
Even the job cuts in tech are relatively small compared with tens of thousands of employees laid off at the outset of last year.
This resilience in the labor force has coincided with a prolonged period of high interest rates at the Federal Reserve, which typically slow the economy and increase the risk of job cuts.
""Layoffs and firings are unusually rare throughout the economy,"" Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, told ABC News. ""It's surprising to me that employment hasn't fallen more.""
Still, the job cuts at Big Tech firms could portend layoffs in other sectors, since the wider economy remains vulnerable to disruption from artificial intelligence, as well as from losses induced by high interest rates, some analysts said.
Layoffs at Google, for instance, affected hundreds of workers focused on the company's well-known products, such as Google Assistant, as well as Google-owned YouTube.
The cuts came in part from the company's priority shift toward AI, according to an internal memo from CEO Sundar Pichai, confirmed to ABC News by a Google spokesperson.
Apple did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. Neither did Amazon.
Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, takes part in a discussion at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit Nov. 16, 2023, in San Francisco.

""Tech companies are hiring and firing on a small scale very often because they're still experimenting with how to commercialize and scale AI,"" Daniel Keum, a professor of management at the Columbia University Business School, told ABC News.
""Surely AI will spread – it will just spread at an uneven pace across different sectors,"" Keum added, noting that he expects AI adoption to ripple through the economy over about 10 years. ""People should be concerned.""
Corey Stahle, an economist at job-listing website Indeed, acknowledged a shift toward AI may be responsible for some of the layoffs in tech, but he rejected the notion of imminent cuts in other sectors due to the technology.
""We're not at that point,"" Stahle told ABC News. ""These technologies are unlocking human potential and making workers more productive and efficient so far.""
Employees across the economy, according to some analysts, also are at risk of layoffs due to high interest rates, which make it more costly for companies to borrow money.

The tech sector is particularly sensitive to elevated borrowing costs, Chris Kayes, a professor at George Washington University School of Business, told ABC News, pointing out that tech firms often rely on loans for an extended period of time before they turn a profit.
Even Big Tech companies, Kayes added, depend on borrowed funds to support some of their spending.
Despite indications from the Fed of rate cuts later this year, companies economy-wide will need to weather an environment of high borrowing costs for the foreseeable future, leaving their employees vulnerable to cuts.
""That will continue to be something hanging over the job market,"" Kayes said.

2024-01-17,Elon Musk wants more control of Tesla. Why some experts say it could be risky,The move would tie the company's fate closer to its high-profile founder.,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk is seeking greater voting control of the electric carmaker, threatening to otherwise pursue major projects such as artificial intelligence outside of the company, he said in a post on X.
The Tesla board, Musk said, should grant him 25% voting control, an amount that would nearly double the vote share currently afforded to Musk through his stake in the company.
The move would tie the company's fate even more closely to its high-profile leader, ensuring Tesla will develop AI in-house at a time when the technology stands poised to shape the auto industry and a range of other sectors, proponents say.
Critics, however, caution of a risky precedent if the company's board were to comply with the request, empowering Musk in any future dispute with shareholders little more than a year after he sold a large number of Tesla shares to help fund his acquisition of X, formerly known as Twitter.
""Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk and AI is a key to the future of Tesla,"" Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush, who is bullish on Tesla, said in a memo to investors on Tuesday.

According to Ives, Musk currently owns roughly 13% of Tesla. Before selling shares in 2022 to fund the $44 billion acquisition of X, Musk owned about 22% of Tesla, Ives added.
Musk, who co-founded ChatGPT-maker OpenAI but left the organization in 2018, announced the formation of a new AI company in July.
The possible development of AI outside of Tesla would deliver a significant blow to the company's prospects, Ives said, citing the critical role of the technology in projects like full self-driving capability.
""If Musk ultimately went down the path to create his own company separate from Tesla for his next generation AI projects this would clearly be a big negative for the Tesla story,"" Ives added.
Ultimately, the board and Musk could reach a compensation agreement in as few as three months that leaves both sides satisfied, Ives said, adding that the move would ensure some viewed by many as a tech visionary would lead ""the new era of AI technology coming to Tesla.""
Gary Black, managing partner at the Future Fund, who is also bullish on Tesla, echoed the sentiment in a post on X. ""Still plenty of time for the [Tesla] Board and Elon to come up with a new comp plan that properly aligns incentives,"" Black said.
However, an agreement that expands Musk's stake in the company could embolden him to assert even greater control down the road.
Such a prospect is especially concerning at a time when Tesla has weathered multiple product recalls and declining profit margins, Gordon Johnson, CEO and founder of data firm GLJ Research, who is bearish on Tesla, told ABC News.

""Musk is holding the company hostage,"" Johnson said.
""The prospects for Tesla are dismal,"" Johnson added, saying the demand from Musk offers him a pretext for departing the company. ""He sees the writing on the wall.""
In December, Tesla agreed to recall about 2 million cars over a safety issue tied to its autopilot system, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said. Earlier this month, the company recalled an additional 1.6 million vehicles exported to China, citing a problem with the car's assisted steering system.

Further, Irwin downplayed the role of AI in the company, disputing the key claim made by Musk about his need for greater voting control.
""Tesla has done a great job with self-driving but it's mostly a misnomer and cake dressing,"" Irwin said. ""Is this an AI or robotics company? How much do they really have? In my view, not much.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

""Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,"" Moriarty claimed in a statement. ""Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.""
The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.
Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.
That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.
Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.
Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.
In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.
Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.
""The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons,"" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. ""This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.""
White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, ""The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,"Bills, Steelers fans dig through snow to find seats in stands",요약 없음,"ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- The impact of the storm that caused the wild-card playoff game between the  Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers to be rescheduled to Monday was visible throughout the stands as many fans dug their way through snow to the seats.
The playing field was completely cleared of snow -- as were the parking lots, although a shuttle was provided as an option to get fans to the game.
A majority of the seats remained covered in snow when the stadium opened for fans at 2:30 p.m., but most of the walkways were accessible, with that having become the priority once it was clear all the snow would not be able to be removed from the seats.
Some fans used shovels from guest services to find their way to their seats, while others used pieces of cardboard to dig out the snow. Some walked through the snow to clear a pathway in a particular row. Snow remained in parts of all three decks of the stadium, with many fans beginning to clear snow as they made their way to their seats. Many sat on pieces of cardboard for a dry surface, but a number of fans were standing as things got underway.
With a significant amount of snow remaining in the stands, snowballs being thrown onto the field during the game seems inevitable.
Sunshine and a blue sky were over Highmark Stadium for some of the time leading up to the game before transitioning to a gray sky. Winds remain a concern for the game, with wind gusts up to 15 mph expected to go along with temperatures in the teens, per the National Weather Service. As announced in the press box before the game, it will feel like it's about 4 degrees.
Steelers safety Minkah Fitzpatrick warmed up for the game sleeveless, and Bills interim offensive coordinator Joe Brady did his usual laps around the field wearing shorts.
The artificial turf field was completely cleared of snow by the time teams went out to warm up, thanks to a tarp having covered the turf during the storm and the equipment, including tractors, used to remove any lingering snow leading up to kickoff. Over 2 feet of snow fell in Orchard Park due to lake effect snow over the weekend that led to the game being pushed back from 1 p.m. ET on Sunday to 4:30 p.m. on Monday.
Some shovelers were able to walk to the stadium Sunday, but once travel bans in the region began to lift, shovelers were asked to come to the stadium Sunday evening and into Monday to help clear the seats in the stadium along with members of the Bills' staff. They were paid $20 per hour.
The Bills reminded fans attending Monday's game to ""please dress appropriately for the cold weather including waterproof boots and pants.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
날짜 없음,"Field at Bills' stadium clear, but snow still covers stands",요약 없음,"ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- The sun was shining Monday on Highmark Stadium, where the green artificial turf was cleared of snow, but the stands were still covered in a white blanket some five hours before the Buffalo Bills host the Pittsburgh Steelers in the storm-delayed AFC wild-card playoff game.
The remnants of the lake-effect snow band that dumped more than 2 feet of snow on the Bills' home in suburban Orchard Park moved north toward Buffalo, allowing for a large crew of shovelers -- volunteers being paid $20 an hour -- and a fleet of front-load tractors to clear the facility.
Kickoff was set for 4:30 p.m. ET for a game originally scheduled to be played at 1 p.m. Sunday, when the brunt of the storm was hitting the region, with much of it centered on Orchard Park. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in consultation with the NFL had postponed the game on Saturday, citing public safety concerns.
Fans were allowed into the stadium at 2:30 p.m. ET.
Shovel crews have been working on clearing the stadium seats, walkways and tunnels since Sunday, when snow fell at a rate of more than 2 inches per hour. Crews worked overnight, with the Bills making a plea for more volunteers early Monday.
Major roadways leading to the stadium were cleared, with 5-foot snowdrifts lining the roads. It was unclear whether crews would have enough time to clear the 70,000-seat stadium's three decks in time for kickoff.
The National Weather Service forecast for Monday called for a chance of snow showers through the early afternoon, with a high of 18 degrees. Temperatures were expected to dip to 14, with winds ranging from 8 to 16 mph.
The Bills reminded fans attending Monday's game to ""please dress appropriately for the cold weather including waterproof boots and pants.""

2024-01-11,Walmart using new technology to help shoppers,Walmart CEO Doug McMillon announced at CES that the company is debuting new technologies like AI and AR to reimagine the shopping experience.,"Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.
Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.
Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.
""Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,"" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. ""We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.""
Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.

""Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,"" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.
Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise ""best efforts"" and failed to take ""'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.""
The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.
In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit ""baseless.""
""Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,"" the company claimed. ""This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.""
Kroger said the company ""looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.""

2024-01-10,Documents name alleged Jeffrey Epstein associates previously identified by accuser,Another batch of documents pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein was unsealed Tuesday.,"Another batch of documents pertaining to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was unsealed Tuesday.
The seven documents unsealed Tuesday total 1,482 pages. They're the last set to be made public pursuant to the court's order authorizing the release last month. Over 215 documents have been released since last week.
The unsealed documents include several depositions from Ghislaine Maxwell, one from Epstein, one from alleged Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre and another from Sarah Ransome, an alleged adult victim of Epstein, who was referenced throughout Monday's unsealing.
The records are part of a defamation lawsuit brought by Giuffre against Maxwell, Epstein's longtime companion, that the two settled in 2017. Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.
The Giuffre deposition included in the new batch comes from her testimony in a related defamation case filed by her lawyers against former Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz in a Florida state court. In that deposition, she names billionaire retail magnate Les Wexner as ""one of the powerful business executives"" that she was trafficked to.
Wexner, who in 1991 granted Epstein power-of-attorney over his personal finances, has never been charged with a crime. After Epstein's arrest in 2019, ABC News obtained a message Wexner issued to employees at L Brands that said, ""When Mr. Epstein was my personal money manager, he was involved in many aspects of my financial life. But let me assure you that I was NEVER aware of the illegal activity charged in the indictment.""
In this March 15, 2005 file photo, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell attend The 2005 Wall Street Concert Series Benefitting Wall Street Rising at Cipriani Wall Street in New York.

Following Epstein's death in August 2019, Wexner accused Epstein of misappropriating ""vast sums"" of his personal fortune more than a decade earlier.
Wexner stepped down from his executive role at L Brands – the conglomerate behind retail staples Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works and Pink – in February 2020.
Wexner's charitable foundation did not immediately respond to ABC News' messages seeking comment on the filings released Tuesday.
The deposition also contains the names of men Giuffre has previously claimed she had been trafficked to, including Britain's Prince Andrew, Hyatt Hotel chief Thomas Pritzker, the late artificial intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky and the late New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson.
Pritzker and Richardson previously issued statements denying the allegations.
Minsky died in 2016, before Giuffre's allegations naming him were released in 2019 by the 2nd Circuit.

Giuffre's 2016 deposition also includes her claim that she met former President Bill Clinton not once but twice on Jeffrey Epstein's private Caribbean island toward the end of her time in Epstein's orbit in September 2002 – something he has denied.
Giuffre said she met Clinton ""On Little Saint Jeff's,"" referring to the island properly known as Little Saint James
She claimed to have been at a dinner with Clinton and two girls: ""Young, beautiful like every girl that's generally around Jeffrey.""
The second meeting was also on the island and also involved a dinner, she said. ""Very similar, I mean, there was a dinner, lots of laughing, lots of joking, it was just a dinner and then I didn't have to do anything with Bill Clinton, he was never sexually involved with me. I've never witnessed him sexually involved with anybody else. Jeffrey asked me for a massage after dinner and I went off to Jeffrey's cabana,"" she said.
Clinton, through a spokesman, denied in 2019 ever being on Epstein's island and said he was not aware of Epstein's criminal behavior.
No documentary evidence has been presented that Clinton was on the island.
Personal flight logs kept by one of Epstein's pilots -- which surfaced in separate lawsuits against Epstein -- showed that Clinton and his entourage had flown extensively on Epstein's jumbo-jet to international destinations such as Paris, Bangkok and Brunei in 2002 and 2003. But none of the available records included the former president on a trip to Epstein's island.
Maxwell also denied Clinton was ever on the island and Giuffre's efforts to depose the former president to ask him whether he had been on the island were rejected by a judge in June 2016.
In a January 2016 email to Maxwell, Epstein encouraged her to focus her effort to discredit Giuffre on Giuffre's version of ""the clinton story"" which he said could be ""easily dsiporived,"" an apparent typo for ""disproved.""
Many of the documents released Tuesday have been unsealed and publicly available in various forms. The court is republishing them now with new portions unredacted.
The 134-page Epstein deposition had not been previously released but he was known to have invoked his Fifth Amendment right hundreds of times.
The records unsealed Monday included photos from Ransome and an exhibit that mentions discredited allegations Ransome made about Clinton, former President Donald Trump, Prince Andrew and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson. She later admitted the claims were false.
Neither Clinton, nor Trump, nor Branson was accused by Giuffre, or anyone else besides Ransome, of any wrongdoing in the course of Giuffre's defamation lawsuit against Maxwell. Trump has said he cut-off contact with Epstein many years ago.
In a statement to ABC News on Tuesday, the Virgin Group, on behalf of Branson, said Ransome's allegations against him are ""false, baseless, and unfounded.""
Prince Andrew has long denied allegations that he had sex with Giuffre on three occasions, as she has claimed in court records and interviews. In 2022, Andrew settled a case Giuffre brought against him.
Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence after she was convicted in 2021 of aiding Epstein's sex trafficking of young women and girls. Her appeal will be heard in March.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2024-01-10,How Walmart will use AI to enhance customers' shopping experience,The retail giant gave ABC News an exclusive look at how it plans to use artificial intelligence to transform the way customers shop while at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.,"For one high school student in New Jersey, a single computer science competition fueled a mission to get more teenage girls interested in artificial intelligence, or AI.
Ishani Singh, now 17, was a freshman at High Technology High School in 2021 when she attended a state computer science competition, where she noticed she was only one of a few female students competing.
When Singh went onto compete in the regional competition, she said she was ""shocked"" to see that she was the only female student competing.
""I looked around and there were, like, zero girls, and I was like, 'OK,'"" Singh told ABC News in an interview airing on ""The Year: 2024,"" an annual special airing Dec. 26 on ABC. ""That felt a little weird.""
The experience inspired Singh, now a high school senior, to launch Girls Rule AI, which aims to empower young women to learn about AI, a term that, according to NASA, ""refers to computer systems that can perform complex tasks normally done by human-reasoning, decision making, creating, etc.""
Ishani Singh founded Girls Rule AI after attending a computer science competition where she was the only girl.
ABC News
Since the start of the organization nearly three years ago, Girls Rule AI has taught free courses on AI to over 200 girls in 25 states and six countries around the world, including Kenya and Afghanistan, according to Singh.
Gloria Mwangi, a Girls Rule AI instructor in Kenya, said she believes women working in AI-related fields could be transformative.
""In Kenya, the interest in tech and AI is definitely growing,"" Mwangi told ABC News. ""I think AI has a lot of potential to make a difference for young women here.""
Singh added that the success of her company, she believes, has been in making AI more accessible to more girls.

""I think it's just because girls are a little afraid to just start on this journey in the first place,"" Singh said of the gender difference in AI. ""So, I think by creating this community, I was able to make girls feel a little more more comfortable and just get them more confident in this field.""
Even with the progress, Singh said she feels there is a lot of work to do when it comes to getting girls interested in AI so they can go onto careers in the science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, industries.
According to the American Association of University Women, women currently make up 34% of the STEM workforce and are particularly outnumbered by men in fast-growing and high-paying fields like engineering and computer science.
""We're not at the level that we should be,"" Singh said. ""I think there should be more women in the tech field.""

Singh added that she believes the more young girls who become interested in AI, the greater the experience will be for all people who use the technology.
""If we have this growing surge of interest among girls and women in the field ... they'll be able to provide valuable input into the AI models that we're putting out into the world these days,"" she said. ""So, it's great to see that people have the same passion that I do.""

2024-01-04,Baby boy thriving 1 year after ‘world’s first partial heart transplant’,"A boy has not only survived but is thriving one year after the “world’s first partial heart transplant,” according to Duke Health.","Doctors from Duke Health have reported a medical breakthrough in which an infant that underwent what they say is the ""world's first partial heart transplant"" has not only survived but is thriving, one year following the groundbreaking treatment, according to a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Owen Monroe was born with a heart defect and needed his heart valves and arteries to be fixed. The boy underwent a first-of-its-kind procedure to address the issue in the spring of 2022, when he was just 17 days old.
Now, doctors report that his heart valves and arteries are growing as if they were his own.

""This was completely uncharted territory,"" Dr. Joseph W. Turek, the chief of pediatric cardiac surgery at Duke Children's Hospital & Health Center Durham, North Carolina, told ""Good Morning America.""

Doctors integrated arteries and valves from a donated heart into Owen's heart in hopes the partial transplant would provide Owen a one-time fix for his condition. The heart parts came from another living baby who needed a full heart transplant, but whose native heart had valves and arteries that worked well.
Other treatment options for Owen weren't ideal. Using artificial valves would require multiple replacements as Owen grew, with each surgery carrying with it a significant risk of death. A full heart transplant would likewise entail risks, including requiring a lifetime regimen of immunosuppressants and anti-rejection medication, which can lead to potentially life-threatening complications.
""What we found is that with partial heart transplants, you're on about a quarter of that dose and it's really a non-life-altering dose,"" Turek said.
Owen's parents described the time before their son had the partial transplant surgery as ""terrifying.""

""He went into stage four heart failure within a few hours after birth,"" recalled Tayler Monroe, Owen's mother.
""He was pretty much already out of options,"" added Owen's father, Nick Monroe.

Ultimately, doctors felt the best treatment option for Owen would be a partial heart transplant.
""I hit them with a hard-hitting [question]: 'Have you done this before?'"" Tayler Monroe recounted. ""And they said, 'On five piglets.' And I said, 'I guess Owen's going to be your first human.' And we just put our faith and trust in them.""
Owen's partial heart transplant surgery took eight hours to complete. Twenty-eight days following the procedure, the boy was able to go home.
Today, Owen is a thriving toddler, and doctors are optimistic he will not need additional surgery in the future.
More than a year after receiving a partial heart transplant, Owen is thriving and home with his family.
Courtesy of the Monroe family
""The fact that he's pretty much one and done is the most amazing thing,"" Nick Monroe said.
""We are just eternally, eternally grateful for our donor's family. Truly, Owen would not be here today,"" Tayler Monroe added.
The Monroes said they've been in touch with the family of Kane Pachot, whose heart valves and arteries were donated to save Owen. Pachot's mother said they wanted to raise awareness of the vital importance of organ donation.
Owen's successful case has since paved the way for 12 other children to have the life-saving procedure, in which intact valves from a weakened heart can be donated to another recipient, while the donor receives a full heart transplant – a practice known as a domino heart transplant.
""It's literally changed the world and it's incredible to just be a part of it,"" Tayler Monroe said.
Duke Health says doctors hope to bring the partial transplant treatment option to a full clinical trial as ""the next step to achieving the volume in procedures that would change the availability of hearts by a large amount.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

2023-12-30,LeBron James turns 39: Here are 3 evidence-based approaches he uses to stay fit,LeBron James turned 39 on Saturday. He continues to dominate in the NBA while being the oldest current player.,"LeBron James turned 39 on Saturday, and he continues to dominate in the NBA while being the oldest current player -- and shows no signs of slowing down.
According to James, the key to success is consistency.
In a 2018 interview with author and podcaster Tim Ferriss, James said he's ""very consistent with training my body, rehabbing my body, eating, having my body be very clean throughout this journey because I've always wanted to have a long career, or as long as I could be in this space.""
LeBron James #23 of the Los Angeles Lakers shoots against the Chicago Bulls during the second half at the United Center on December 20, 2023 in Chicago.
Michael Reaves/Getty Images
A 2020 study done on the effects of age and the performance of athletes in the NBA found that players over 30 covered much less distance during games compared to younger players.
MORE: LeBron James breaks record for most career points in NBA history
The Los Angeles Lakers forward ranked ninth in minutes played per game in the 2022-23 season despite being the oldest player in the league. He is currently ranked 38th in average minutes per game this season. The average age of the players ranked above James this season is more than a decade younger than him.
And in February 2023, James set the record for most career points in NBA history, toppling Hall of Famer and fellow Laker Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
Experts say James' consistency and dedication to nutrition, sleep and mental health are working to his advantage. According to nutritionists and fitness experts, anyone can benefit from some of James' most-discussed health practices.
Here are three tips from experts:
Focus on nutrition and fitness
LeBron told Ferriss he keeps his diet as ""clean as possible throughout the season when I’m burning so much and trying to get the recovery back,"" and tries to stay away from ""artificial drinks, artificial sugars and fried foods"" year-round.
Studies suggest that a well-balanced diet of fruits, vegetables and lean proteins can help people live longer.
Kate Patton, a sports nutritionist at the Cleveland Clinic, compared the human body to a sports car to explain that to get longevity, ""you need more expensive gas,"" and for the body, that is ""nutrient-dense food.""
For someone looking to improve their diet, she said eating more whole foods and ""less processed foods"" is very important to encourage muscle recovery and decrease oxidative stress on the body.
Things that are ""nutrition powerhouses"" such as whole grains, vegetables and beans should be a priority, Patton said.
""Ninety percent of any fitness goal is having the correct nutrition for your body type and goals,"" Justin Bauer, a Cleveland, Ohio-based health and fitness coach, said, adding that ""prioritizing nutrition will ensure that you're getting the full benefit of your workouts.""
Experts say anyone can highlight nutrition and fitness in enjoyable ways. Doing what you enjoy both for nutrition and fitness is the best way to see results, Bauer added.

Prioritize sleep
James prioritizes sleep and gets between 8-9 hours a night, sometimes even 10, and has called it self-care. James uses sleep techniques such as keeping his room between 68-70 degrees, having a completely dark room and cutting out distractions, his trainer, Mike Mancias, told Ferriss in 2018.
Dr. Upneet Chawla, a sleep medicine specialist in the greater Chicago area, cited an American Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine study from 2021 that showed poor sleep can negatively affect mental health and increase risk of injury in NBA athletes.
Adequate sleep allows for the body to recover ""physically and emotionally"" so that you're ready to take on the next day at the ""highest level,"" James has said.
""Don't sleep on sleep, make it a priority,"" Chawla said, and suggested sleeping in a dark, cool room, which helps increase the sleep hormone melatonin.
Chawla also suggested sticking to a regular sleep-wake schedule during the week and weekends, and getting 7-8 hours of sleep consistently. Many studies have linked good quality sleep with improved health, she added.

Mental health
Poor mental health can impact your physical health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.
For James, protecting his mental energy is important. When he experiences a loss, he doesn't ""dwell on that loss,"" but rather tries to ""learn from that defeat"" and finds ways to learn and improve, he said. He also talks in his 2018 interview with Ferriss about patience with his teammates, family and himself, and the importance of communication and understanding others' mindsets.
Studies suggest poor mental well-being can weaken the immune system and cause an imbalance between the fight-or-flight and rest systems, which has been associated with heart disease and diabetes.

2023-12-30,Michael Cohen admits fake cases in early release bid came from Google AI program,"Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations in 2018, sought an early end to his term of supervised release.","Former President Donald Trump's onetime fixer Michael Cohen sent his attorney non-existent legal cases produced by the artificial intelligence program Google Bard as he sought to beef up his petition for early termination of his supervised release, according to a letter to the court made public Friday.
Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations in 2018, sought an early end to his term of supervised release in a motion that included three cases he believed backed up his argument. His lawyer said Cohen mistakenly believed Google Bard ""to be a supercharged search engine, not a generative AI service like Chat-GPT.""
That the invalid citations were included in Cohen's motion his attorney insisted ""was a mistake driven by sloppiness, not malicious intent"" but Judge Jesse Furman is now considering whether to impose sanctions.

""As a non-lawyer, I have not kept up with emerging trends (and related risks) in legal technology and did not realize that Google Bard was a generative text service that, like ChatGPT, could show citations and descriptions that looked real but actually were not,"" Cohen said in a sworn statement to the court made public Friday.

In his own letter to the court, Cohen's attorney David M. Schwartz said he believed the legal citations came from a different attorney for Cohen, Danya Perry.
""If I had believed that Mr. Cohen had found these cases, I would have researched them. It was my belief, however, that Mr. Cohen had sent me cases found by Ms. Perry,"" Schwartz said.
Judge Furman gave all parties until January 3 to submit additional comments about possible sanctions and whether Cohen deserves early termination of supervised release.",,,,,,,,,,,,

2023-12-29,7 of the biggest medical breakthroughs in 2023,"From the first-ever RSV vaccines to the first drug fully approved to treat Alzheimer's disease, here are seven of the biggest medical breakthroughs in 2023.","From new vaccines to the first drugs of their kind for hard-to-treat disorders, 2023 has been a year full of medical breakthroughs.
They offer opportunities for people to protect themselves from diseases, slow down the effects of others and even incorporate artificial intelligence into cancer diagnoses.
Here are seven of the biggest innovations in the health and science space this year.
MORE: Record number of Americans have signed up for Obamacare this year, HHS says
New RSV vaccines and immunizations
For the first time ever, after years of setbacks, there are multiple vaccines and shots available for several different groups to prevent RSV.
For adults over age 60, who are at higher risk for serious complications from RSV because immune systems weaken with age, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two vaccines.
""So much focus is placed on flu and now COVID. but, each year in the U.S., we see tens of thousands of older adults hospitalized from RSV, thousands die from RSV complications,"" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor.
""It still has significant public health consequences for those that are most vulnerable, and so now having a high efficacy vaccine is really a tremendous breakthrough for the last year and I think will have significant public health benefit for years to come,"" he added.
The US FDA approves GSK's Arexvy, the world's first respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV) vaccine for older adults.
Business Wire/AP
The FDA also approved a maternal RSV vaccine, which is given to pregnant mothers in the third trimester between 32 weeks' and 36 weeks' gestation and is designed to pass antibodies to babies in the womb. It can provide protection from severe illness through the first six months of life.
Lastly, for babies under 8 months old, there are two monoclonal antibody shots available. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the body's ability to fight off pathogens. They are different from vaccines, which stimulate the immune system.
1st CRISPR gene-editing technique to treat sickle cell
Earlier this month, the FDA approved two gene therapies to treat sickle cell disease (SCD), including the first CRISPR gene-editing therapy.
SCD is a genetic condition in which red blood cells have a crescent, or sickle, shape, causing them to be hard and sticky.
""It is a disease that really touches every organ in the body,"" Dr. Sharl Azar, medical director of the Comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, told ABC News. ""A quarter of our patients will have had a stroke by the time they're in their 40s. Many of our patients will have had their first joint replacement by the time they're in their 30s. Many others will have had their first heart attack in their 20s.""
MORE: Federal judge says research can't be used to link acetaminophen to autism, ADHD
""If the disease goes unchecked, it can lead to blindness, it can lead to dialysis dependence and most of our patients may not see their 45th or 50th birthday,"" he continued.
One of these therapies, Lyfgenia, uses a piece of a virus to deliver a gene for fetal hemoglobin, which prevents blood cells from sticking together and constricting blood flow, which is delivered back into the patient.
The other therapy, Casgevy, used CRISPR/Cas9 to genetically edit the stem cells to produce more fetal hemoglobin, which are then also put back into the patient
""From a scientific and medical standpoint, both of these therapies aim to do the same thing, they just do it in a slightly different way,"" Azar said. ""So, the important thing to emphasize here is that these are not a cure for sickle cell disease. The patients will still have sickle cell disease on the other side of the intervention. The hope is that they will just have a milder form of the disease, where they can see a lot less pain and hopefully fewer complications and hopefully even a longer life.""
Over-the-counter birth control pill
In July, the FDA approved the first over-the-counter birth control pill, meaning it can be sold without a prescription.
Called Opill by French drugmaker HRA Pharma and its parent company Perrigo, public health experts have said it will broaden birth control access for millions of people in the United States.
This illustration provided by Perrigo in May, 2023, depicts proposed packaging for the company's birth control medication Opill.
Perrigo via AP
Opill is a progestin-only pill -- sometimes called the ""minipill"", meaning it doesn't contain estrogen like combination birth control pills. Doctors say progestin-only pills pose fewer medical risks than combination pills.
The drug is expected to appear on shelves at convenience stores, grocery chains and online in early 2024.
Scientists pinpoint possible cause of morning sickness
Morning sickness is an extremely common early symptom of pregnancy, with up to 80% of pregnant women experiencing it in the first trimester -- and now researchers believe they have discovered the cause.
A team mainly from the U.S., U.K. and Sri Lanka discovered a link between a hormone called GDF15, produced by the fetus in the placenta, and morning sickness.
Results, published earlier this month in the journal Nature, found women with severe nausea and vomiting and blood levels of GDF15 during the first trimester that were significantly higher compared to women who didn't experience sickness.
MORE: COVID-19 and flu continue to increase but CDC director believes US has hit peak of RSV,
Additionally, women who are more sensitive to the hormone become the sickest, which may explain the small percentage of women who suffer an extreme form of morning sickness hyperemesis gravidarum, which is the leading cause of hospitalization in the early stage of pregnancy and famously experienced by Catherine, Princess of Wales during all three of her pregnancies.
Researchers said the finding could help treat women with morning sickness, especially severe forms, by lowering levels of the hormone during pregnancy.
First drug fully approved by the FDA to treat Alzheimer's
In the past, Alzheimer's disease treatment has been marked by several drugs that have failed clinical trials but, in July, the FDA granted full approval for a new drug called Leqembi.
Manufactured by the pharmaceutical companies Eisai and Biogen, it is the first drug of its kind that has shown to slow cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's patients.
Leqembi works by targeting amyloid beta, the main component of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients and affects memory and thought. It marks the plaques for clearance by the body's immune system, which slows Alzheimer's symptoms.
""It's a significant milestone in Alzheimer's disease treatment,"" Brownstein said. ""It is a very big step in giving individuals suffering from this disease more time, and clinical trials have shown to modestly slow cognitive decline, especially in people with early Alzheimer's disease, and so by slowing cognitive decline, that drug could provide individuals more time to engage in activities that they enjoy.""
This Dec. 21, 2022, image provided by Eisai in January 2023, shows vials and packaging for their medication Leqembi.

Brownstein noted that there are still questions surrounding the drug's accessibility. The full approval means Medicare can start covering the cost of treatment for patients, making it more widely available, but that's for a subset of patients.
""This drug, like many others, requires substantial investment for research and development, and so, because of that, companies use drug pricing to recover the costs associated with developing and bringing these drugs to market,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, that pricing, that means that this drug will be out of reach for some, and that's really something that needs to be addressed because of course, this drug should be available to anyone suffering from this disease.""
An mRNA vaccine to treat pancreatic cancer
A research team funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a personalized mRNA vaccine with partners at BioNTech, against pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest forms of cancer in the U.S.
BioNTech performed gene sequencing on more samples to identify neoantigens -- proteins that are unique to cancer cells – that may stimulate an immune response.
In early clinical trials, patients received a drug that inhibits cancer cells from suppressing the immune system, then were given their personalized vaccine split in nine doses over many months.
Eighteen of the 19 patients successfully had vaccines created for them and 16 were healthy enough to receive at least some of the doses, according to the NIH.

About half of the patients saw the vaccine trigger T cells, a type of immune system cell that destroys infected cells, that targeted the specific cancer cells in each patient.
Among the patients who saw the strong immune system response, the cancer did not return after a year and a half of treatment, including chemotherapy. In those who did not have a strong immune system response, the caner retuned within a year, according to results published earlier this year in the journal Nature.
""It's exciting to see that a personalized vaccine could enlist the immune system to fight pancreatic cancer—which urgently needs better treatments,"" Dr. Vinod Balachandran, a surgical oncologist from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said in a statement. ""It's also motivating as we may be able to use such personalized vaccines to treat other deadly cancers.""
AI boosts breast cancer detection rates
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly used in scientific trials, and a new tool developed this year is helping spot more breast cancer than human screenings.
The tool, named Mia and developed by Imperial College London and Kheiron Medical Technologies detected 13% more early breast cancers.
Across the two pilot phases and the live roll out, Mia detected 24 more cancers and led to 70 more women being recalled, according to a release from Imperial College London.
Of the women who were recalled, additional cancers were found, which raised cancer detection rates by 13%.
""These results have exceeded our expectations,"" Dr Ben Glocker, a professor in machine learning for imaging at ICL, said in a statement. ""These results have exceeded our expectations. Our study shows that using AI can act as an effective safety net -- a tool to prevent subtler signs of cancer falling through the cracks. Seeing firsthand that the use of AI could substantially reduce the rate of missed cancers in breast screening is massive, and a major boost for our mission to transform cancer care with AI technology.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
2023-12-28,The stock market boomed this year. What will happen in 2024?,Interest rate cuts could rally stocks in 2024 but the measures also pose risks.,"Shaking off a woeful performance last year, the stock market soared to record highs in 2023.
The S&P 500 -- the index that most people's 401(k)'s track -- climbed nearly 25% this year, as of Wednesday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average leapt 13%; while the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose a staggering 44%.
Looking ahead, a central question looms over Wall Street: Will the good times keep rolling?
The stellar performance owed in large part to optimism about the prospects for a ""soft landing,"" in which inflation comes down to normal levels while the economy avoids a recession, prominent experts said in end-of-year reports. Investor enthusiasm about AI also helped drive returns, they added.
MORE: The US economy defied warnings of disaster. Where is it headed in 2024?
Analysts differ significantly in their outlooks for 2024, however, while some fear a potential downturn could bludgeon markets and others expect slow but steady growth that will lift stock prices.
The U.S. economy achieved some major successes this year, emboldening investors and rallying markets.
Inflation continued to fall from a peak of about 9% last summer, reaching within a percentage point of the Fed's target rate. While hiring slowed lately, it remained robust.
All the while, economic growth surged. The U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 4.9% over three months ending in September, more than doubling growth in the previous quarter, a government report in October showed.
The progress on inflation prompted a landmark announcement from the Fed earlier this month: Plans to reverse its near-historic rate hikes with a series of cuts next year.
Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America Securities, told investors last month that the slowdown of price increases bodes well for markets, regardless of the Fed's actions next year.
""We're bullish not because we expect the Fed to cut, but because of what the Fed has accomplished,"" Subramanian said.
Still, other analysts have cautioned that interest rates continue to pose a major risk for stocks, since a misstep could either plunge the economy into a downturn or rekindle rapid price increases.

""We deferred a recession this year,"" Barry Bannister, a market strategist at wealth management firm Stifel who holds a cautious view of stock performance in 2024, told ABC News.
Policymakers face a difficult task of continuing to slow the economy and cool inflation while averting a downturn. At the same time, if officials boost economic and business growth, they risk a rebound of inflation as consumer demand swells, Bannister added.
""There are two extremes,"" he said. ""It's either too hot or too cold, but not just right.""
Another key driver of market gains this year was the rise of artificial intelligence. Major stock indexes drew a bump from investors optimistic about benefits of the newly prominent technology, especially over the early months of the year.
However, those gains were concentrated primarily in a handful of tech giants, known as the magnificent seven: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia.
Nvidia, a California-based chip maker whose products help power artificial intelligence platforms like ChatGPT, may best encapsulate this phenomenon. The stock skyrocketed nearly 240% this year, as of Wednesday.
MORE: Unions made 2023 the year of the strike. What will happen next?
Earnings delivered by the S&P 500 trace to a level of concentration last seen in the 1970s, Morgan Stanley said in a report earlier this month. The absence of broad growth suggests major companies will face ""major headwinds"" next year, Morgan Stanley added.
Subramanian, of Bank of America, rebuked the notion that lofty investor sentiment has outpaced overall business performance. ""Bull markets typically end with high conviction and euphoria -- we are far from that,"" she said in her memo to investors.
At this time last year, the market approached the end of a dismal 2022. Fearing a recession, many forecasters warned of further decline. Instead, a downturn never came to pass and stocks surged.
Above all, the takeaway from recent performance may be one of humility.
Marko Kolanovic, chief global markets strategist at J.P. Morgan, summed up the attitude this month in the bank's 2024 investing outlook: ""Overall, we are cautious.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Delayne Ivanowski of Missouri planned for months in secret to donate her kidney to her dad, who was diagnosed with a type of kidney disease that can lead to kidney failure, despite his objections to her undergoing the surgery.
A day after his successful transplant surgery in February, her dad, John Ivanowski, learned his anonymous donor was his daughter when she walked into his room wearing a hospital gown. A video Delayne Ivanowski posted of the emotional moment went viral on TikTok.
She told ABC News she hopes her family's story helps raise awareness of the need for organ donation.
""It hurts, but all the pain is worth it in the end, I think,"" she said.

2. Viral cat dubbed 'largest cat anyone has ever seen' gets adopted
Kay Ford adopted Patches the cat earlier this week after seeing a photo of the 40-pound cat in a social media post shared by Richmond Animal Care and Control in Richmond, Virginia.

When the Richmond Animal Care and Control in Virginia put out a call on Facebook to adopt Patches, ""the largest cat anyone has ever seen,"" hundreds of interested applicants were up for the challenge of putting the 40.3-pound feline on the path toward a safe and healthy weight.
The following day, the shelter determined that a local woman named Kay Ford would be Patches' new owner.
""He's very easy to fall in love with,"" Ford told ""Good Morning America"" at the time. ""I truly feel incredibly blessed that I was the chosen one.""
Ford has chronicled Patches' journey on social media in the months since the adoption, reporting recently that he's down to 28.63 pounds.
""35 weeks ago today Patches joined our family,"" Ford said in a Dec. 20 post. ""I cannot imagine our lives without him.""
3. Teen saves sister from attempted kidnapping with slingshot
13-year-old Owen Burns spoke about how he used a slingshot to prevent his 8-year-old sister from a suspected kidnapping.
WGTU
A Michigan teenager was hailed as a quick-thinking hero after he helped save his younger sister during an attempted kidnapping in May by shooting the suspect with his slingshot, authorities said.
The teen -- Owen Burns -- told ""Good Morning America"" he saw the suspect grab his sister in their backyard. He grabbed his slingshot, a marble and a rock and shot the suspect three times in the head and chest, he said.
His parents said they were ""extremely proud and forever grateful"" for their son's bravery.
The 18-year-old suspect pleaded guilty this month to one count of kidnapping-child enticement and one count of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder.
4. FedEx driver helps rescue man from burning car

When FedEx driver Jonathan Rohrbach happened upon a burning car while driving during his overnight shift in July, he didn't hesitate to act. The Californian helped pull the injured driver from the car before it became fully engulfed in flames.
The dramatic aftermath of the crash was captured by a cameraman from San Diego ABC affiliate KGTV who had also responded to the scene.
""I just happened to be the right guy in the right place at the right time,"" Rohrbach told ABC News at the time. ""I did what I think anybody would do. Just saw a guy that needed help so I stopped and helped him.""
During a reunion nearly two weeks later in the hospital, the driver -- Jorge Herrera -- tearfully thanked Rohrbach.
""I don't think I would be here without his help,"" Herrera said.
5. Ocean cleanup group removes record level of trash from Great Pacific Garbage Patch
Tens of thousands of pounds of trash are sorted after being removed from the Great Garbage Patch on August 10, 2023.
The Ocean Cleanup
It's been a record-breaking year for one ocean cleanup group.
In August, nonprofit environmental engineering organization Ocean Cleanup said it removed about 25,000 pounds of trash from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch -- its largest single extraction ever.
The following month, the group said it broke its own record by removing more than 40,000 pounds of plastic from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
The world's five ocean garbage patches -- the largest of which is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch -- pose dangers to the local ecosystem by entangling marine life in fishing nets, animals eating plastic and other debris and by transporting non-native species from foreign habitats, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The Ocean Cleanup aims to remove 90% of floating plastic from the oceans by 2040, which they believe is achievable.
6. Scientific breakthrough helps woman speak for 1st time in 18 years after stroke
Ann Johnson lost her ability to speak nearly 20 years ago after suffering a paralyzing stroke at the age of 30. She is now able to talk again through an avatar thanks to artificial intelligence in what experts say is a medical milestone.
A team of doctors and researchers at the University of California, San Francisco and UC Berkeley discovered a way to use Johnson's brain signals and translate them into words and avatar movements using AI. They used a clip from her wedding video to restore her voice to the way it sounded.
""Seeing her reaction to the work is really I think what motivates all of us,"" Sean Metzger, a Ph.D. student who worked on the research, told ABC News in August. ""She described that it was an emotional moment to hear her voice again.""
This type of technology has been in the works for decades, according to Dr. Leah Croll, a neurologist and stroke specialist.
""This is the first time that it's starting to feel like a real medical miracle is potentially in our grasp in the future,"" Croll, who didn't work on this particular case, told ABC News Live. ""We could really restore neurologic function in patients who have lost it.""

American caver Mark Dickey was more than 3,400 feet below the surface when he fell ill while on an expedition inside the Morca Cave in southern Turkey's Taurus Mountains on Aug. 31.
Too sick to climb out and suffering from life-threatening bleeding and vomiting, what followed was a complex rescue operation that began with his fiancée -- Jessica Van Ord, a fellow caver and paramedic -- making the difficult decision to leave Dickey and make the hourslong climb to the surface to alert authorities on Sept. 2.
The call to help him went out from the European Cave Rescue Association that same day and hundreds of aid workers from various countries responded. After days of prep, Dickey was safely extracted from the cave at around 12:37 a.m. local time on Sept. 12.
While recuperating in the hospital following his rescue, Dickey told ABC News that he's ""alive because of the rescuers,"" whom he called ""heroes,"" but also credited his fiancée with ""initially"" saving his life.
""She saved my life, period,"" he said. ""She is one hell of a woman, one hell of a caver, one hell of a rescuer, one hell of a paramedic.""
8. NASA astronaut breaks record for longest trip to space by an American
Astronaut Frank Rubio set a new U.S. spaceflight record, eclipsing the previous record of 355 consecutive days aboard the Space Station.
NASA
NASA astronaut Frank Rubio spent most of 2023 in space -- for a record-breaking feat. He became the longest-serving NASA U.S. astronaut in space and the first American to spend more than a year in space after orbiting the Earth for a total of 371 days.
The record wasn't intentional; his original six-month mission at the International Space Station was extended after a leak was detected from the spacecraft that was to return the crew back to Earth and they had to wait for a replacement.
In an interview with ""Good Morning America"" prior to breaking the record, Rubio said he felt honored to hold the title and that he expected the record would be broken again in the future.
""I think this is really significant in the sense that it teaches us that the human body can endure, it can adapt and as we prepare to push back to the moon and then from then onward onto hopefully Mars and further on in the solar system,"" he said. ""I think it's really important that we learn just how the human body learns to adapt and how we can optimize that process so that we can improve our performance as we explore further and further out from Earth.""
The current record for most consecutive days spent in space overall belongs to Russian cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, who spent 437 days in space.
9. Construction workers rescued in India
National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel along with other rescue operatives gather at the entrance of the under construction Silkyara during a rescue operation for trapped workers after a section of the tunnel collapsed, in the Uttarkashi district of India's Uttarakhand state on Nov. 28, 2023.

The year saw another complex, dramatic rescue in India, when dozens of construction workers became trapped in a collapsed tunnel under the Himalayas.
Forty-one workers became trapped early on Nov. 12 when a landslide in Uttarakhand state caused a portion of the tunnel they were building to collapse about 650 feet from the entrance.
Rescuers used pipes to send food, water and oxygen to the trapped workers. Heavy machines and hand-held drilling tools were used to help dig them out.
After more than two weeks trapped in the collapsed tunnel, all 41 construction workers were rescued in good health on Nov. 28.
A rescuer told the New Delhi Television channel that “the trapped workers were overjoyed when they spotted us in the tunnel. Some rushed toward me and hugged me,” The Associated Press reported.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the successful rescue operation emotional and said the workers' patience and courage were inspiring.
10. Hiker survives 1,000-foot tumble from Hawaii hiking trail
Ian Snyder, 34, speaks at a news conference in Hawaii on Dec. 12, 2023, about surviving a 1,000-foot topple from a hiking trail in Hawaii.
KITV
A California father of three was hiking alone on the Ko'olau Summit Trail in Hawaii earlier this month when his outing went from routine to treacherous.
Ian Snyder told reporters during a news conference this month that he was hiking along the peaks of the trail and doesn't remember exactly when happened when he toppled and fell 1,000 feet, breaking his arm in the process.
When he never returned from his hike, his family reported him missing to police. Snyder spent three days stranded at the bottom of a waterfall before he was found by a rescue crew.
Snyder said it was a ""miracle"" he survived.
""I'm glad to be here, incredibly glad to be here and glad to be in mostly one piece,"" he said.
Amber Fonte, a member of the Oahu Hiking Community, also said at the news conference that she was resigned to just returning Snyder's body to his family.
""When we found a whole human living and breathing and waving at the sky, I was like, 'Merry Christmas,'"" Fonte said.",,,,,,,,,,,,
